Built on the Ethereum blockchain, 1inch was founded in May 2019 by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov during an ETHGlobal hackathon. Kunz previously worked as a software engineer for Porsche, while Bukov was a developer who previously worked on the NEAR Protocol. The 1INCH token is the governance and utility token of the 1inch Network. The token is applied in different capacities in the two existing protocols and will be used in the tokenomics of all new protocols released by the 1inch Network. 1INCH is a multichain token, currently available on Ethereum and BNB Chain over a bridge. This protocol incorporates the Pathfinder, a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths in within one protocol in the shortest possible time. 1inch Limit Order Protocol is a set of smart contracts, that can work on any EVM based blockchains (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche). Key features of the protocol is extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency that achieved by using two different order types - regular Limit Order and RFQ Order. The 1inch DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that governs the 1inch Network, enabling 1INCH token stakers to vote for key protocol parameters and take part in the network\\'s governance. The 1inch spot price aggregator is a set of smart contracts that extract price data for tokens traded on DEXes from the blockchain. To avoid price manipulations within a transaction, the spot price aggregator should ONLY be used off-chain. DO NOT use it on-chain. The 1inch Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and the native mobile wallet of the 1inch Network. This wallet offers users an easy entry into DeFi, providing access to deep liquidity across multiple blockchains and better rates for crypto swaps than any single cryptocurrency exchange. Moreover, the 1inch Wallet saves users time, as they no longer have to manually check each exchange for the best swap prices. ", "Aave is a decentralized protocol where users can borrow tokens by depositing more collateral than what is being borrowed[1]. It was first known as ETHLend when it launched with an ICO in 2017. AAVE, then known as ETHLend, launched in an ICO in November 2017 with the tagline: \"Democratizing Lending with Ethereum Network\"[2] raising a total of $17m. Aave Governance consists of the proposition and decision-making process for the different risk parameter changes, improvements and incentives that constitute the policies, and upgrades to governance itself.[3] Aave is secured by a Safety Module (SM), a staking mechanism for AAVE tokens to act as insurance against Shortfall Events (events caused when borrowed coins &gt; collateral coins, which cause defaults). Stakers earn AAVE as Safety Incentives (SI) along with a percentage of protocol fees[4]. This project was launched in November 2017 as a P2P lending platform called ETHLend and later renamed Aave in September 2018. The platform was created to allow lending in a decentralized manner between two users. Therefore, a peer-to-peer (P2P) model was used that allowed the exchange of information and money directly between users. This p2p model, however, proved to be inefficient because there was a need to have demand rather than supply. It was then passed to a peer-to-contract (P2C) model, in which the funds were deposited within a special contract that allowed users to use them instantaneously by paying the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clender\\xe2\\x80\\x9d an interest fee.[5] The relationship between the pool\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liquidity and the demand to borrow will determine the interest rates. So, when the demand for borrowing increases, it reduces available liquidity, interest rates rise, and depositors generate more income. In AAVE V1 assets that were being used as collateral were tied up, but now with V2 they are free to be traded. Users can trade their deposited assets, across all currencies supported in the Aave Protocol, even when they are being used as collateral. [6] V3 focuses on two things: risk awareness/mitigation, and capital efficiency. As a result, V3 introduces \\xe2\\x80\\x9cisolated markets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this allows Aave governance to list assets as collateral faster, but only as a single source of collateral, and not as a bundle. Additionally, isolated markets will have supply caps controlled by the DAO governance and as that asset matures they can increase the ceilings until eventually turning off the isolation model or the particular asset. So it kind of allows asset scalability V3 will also include \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh efficiency mode.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This feature will allow users to leverage extremely high loan-to-value ratios so long as they take loans in the same asset that they deposit as collateral \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in some instances, even up to 98% LTV.

It offers an APY of up to 19.5% to stablecoin depositors and provides borrowers easy access to collateral-backed stablecoin loans. The platform was built by the South Korea-based Terraform Labs and launched on March 17, 2021. It was created in part to boost the overall demand for Terra\\'s native stablecoin, UST. The current TVL of Anchor is over $15b.[1] Anchor protocol, as do all money markets, offers lending and over-collateralized borrowing of crypto assets. It uses a selection of assets that can be used as collateral and only allows borrowers to take out UST loans. Anchor protocols uses only bonded PoS cryptocurrencies as collateral. Whenever a user wants to provide collateral for a loan, he has to bond the crypto asset (ex. LUNA bonded into bLUNA, ETH bonded into bETH). Through bonding, the user gives up the staking interest of that coin which go to the Anchor protocol for it to pay UST lenders. Once the assets are bonded and deposited into the platform, UST borrowing is allowed. Borrowers pay a variable interest to lenders and are incentivized through ANC emissions thus making borrowing on the Anchor protocol quite cheap. Anchor protocol has gained traction among DeFi users thanks to the high interest (up to 19.5%) paid to UST depositors. This high interest is sustained by: Recently the Anchor governance has approved a proposal which will make UST interest dynamic instead of fixed, depending on the yield reserve status. All loans on Anchor are over-collateralized, that means that the value of the collateral must be greater than the value of the loan. If the loan-to-value ratio falls below a specified percentage, Anchor starts selling the collateral to repay the loan. They use liquidators to observe and liquidate loans with a borrow amount above the allowed borrowing limit.[2] Anchor Protocol\\'s yield reserve has been replenished on two occasions: once in July 2021 for $70 million[3] and once in February 2022 for $450 million.[4] In March 2022, Anchor Protocol governance voted to make the yield rate dynamic.[5] Anchor Protocol is widely seen as the primary driver for the expansion of UST usage. Through March 2022, Anchor provided a static 19.5% yield for UST deposits, funded by borrowing fees and the Anchor yield reserve. Deposits vastly outpaced borrows during this entire period, leading to near-depletions of the yield reserve. Anchor conducted two rounds of top-ups from the Luna Foundation Guard. The Anchor Token (ANC) is Anchor\\'s Protocol\\'s governance token. ANC tokens can be deposited to create new governance polls, which can be voted on by users that have staked a minimum of 1000 ANC.[6] A maximum of 1,000,000,000 ANC tokens will distribute over 4 years.[7] The yield reserve is controlled by the Luna Foundation and it allows the Anchor Protocol to pay a stable yield to UST deposits. It is designed to shrink during times of contraction and to grow during times of expansion, when there is more PoS collateral generating yield and more interest is paid by the borrowers.

Co-founded in the middle of DeFi summer of 2020[1] by Gaspard Peduzzi, APWine pioneers of yield tokenisation with over 20 interest-bearing tokens for users to choose from as of May 2022. Julien Bouteloup, Marc Zeller &amp; Jiahua Xu first backed the project. In May 2021, APWine raised[2] 5.1M USDC during the liquidity bootstrapping event. APWine is deployed on Ethereum &amp; Polygon [3]and the Kovan testnet. In essence, APWine is a derivatives layer for DeFi yield that introduced two new primitives to DeFi called Principal Token (PT) &amp; Future Yield Token (FYT). The protocol works by first splitting interest-bearing tokens (iBT) like aUSDT of Aave with PT representing your locked position and FYT representing a right to claim the underlying yield accrued over time. APWine pleces Interest Bearing Tokens (iBT) for a fixed duration of time in a smart contract and issues Principal &amp; Future Yield Tokens[4] in return. The smart contract directly receives the yield generated by these assets, and only the holder of the FYTs can redeem the corresponding underlying yield at the end of the period. Both Principal T&amp; Future Yield tokens can be sold back for their Underlying token as APWine doesn\\'t introduce any time-locking mechanism on this process. As PTs &amp; FYTs are regular ERC20 tokens, they can be freely traded, opening up a new market for future yield. APWine is the first yield tokenisation allowing users to fix yield on the Underlying token like USDC in a few clicks without the manual overhead of splitting interest-bearing tokens. Currently, APWine operates in quarterly cycles, meaning users can speculate or hedge from APY volatility up to 90 days ahead. Principal Tokens are not linked to any specific period but to the Future itself, and future Yield Tokens are uniquely associated to each period of a given Future. APWine\\'s AMM is derived from Balancer V1\\'s AMM design. The PT/Underlying pool has dynamic weights and PT/FYT constant 50/50 weights. The design of APWine\\'s AMM reduces [5]impermanent loss up to 100% as the price of the PT starts at a discount and progressively converges to the price of one underlying. The weights are updated based on the yield generated to update the discount and protect liquidity providers from arbitrages. This pool design is no different than the one you can find on Uniswap and LPs are subject to impermanent loss. APWine features its SDK allowing any developer to start building atop protocol in a permissionless manner.

Its goal is to build something not unlike the Library of Ashurbanipal, \"a twelve tablet copy of the Epic of Gilgamesh which is regarded as the earliest surviving great work of literature.\"[1] Essentially, Arweave is building a decentralized information archive. The protocols token, AR, is used to pay to have information stored on Arweave. Arweave was founded in 2017, initially named Archain. The prefix <i>ar-</i> is a reference to the word archive.[1] The token, named ARC at launch, held a presale on the website archain.org in August of 2017.

Atrix will provide users and projects the best experience for swapping on and adding liquidity to Serum, and interacting with farms. Order books, such as Serum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, allow markets to efficiently price assets through maximal liquidity distribution expressivity. However, this expressivity can often only be utilized by sophisticated actors such as market makers. Atrix bridges this gap by allowing users to add liquidity directly into Serum through a constant product equation, which benefits protocol users because of its simplicity, and the Serum ecosystem because of increased liquidity. Atrix allocates all tokens deposited into its liquidity pools into Serum based on a constant product equation. Atrix utilizes this equation to create a number of open orders on Serum which are updated as swaps and trades are performed. Users can create liquidity pools for any Serum market. Depositing liquidity in these pools will return Atrix LP tokens (ALP) which represent a proportional share of the liquidity in the pool. ALP tokens can then be used as money legos in other protocols, or can be staked in Atrix farms. Users can create ALP liquidity mining farms with custom token emissions using an intuitive interface with zero coding knowledge required. Users can choose between allocated emissions, or minted emissions. With allocated emissions, users can deposit an amount of a token they would like to be distributed to stakers. With minted emissions, new tokens are minted every second to be distributed, instead of being allocated upfront, similar to protocols such as Sushiswap. Atrix has no deposit or withdrawal fees. Atrix generates fees like markets makers do on order books. It places order with a 0.20% increase in price, effectively creating a 0.20% fee. All fees are kept by Atrix LPs.

Beefy offers two main kinds of vaults, LP vaults and Single token vaults. The user deposits the LP token in these vaults and the protocol automatically harvests the rewards (most likely liquidity mining incentives), sells them to buy more of the tokens of the liquidity position and increases the LP position with them, finally redepositing the newly received LP tokens back into the vault. This process is called auto-compounding. These vaults accept deposits of a single token and can either just farm and auto-compound the reward from a yield farm or, more frequently, use the following money market strategy: By depositing into a vault the user receives mooTOKENs, a claim on their shares of the vault. There are no deposit or withdrawal fees on Beefy (unless explicitly shown), but there\\'s a performance fee of 4.5% that is already taken into account on the APY of the pools.

The governance token has a triple yield, 30% of protocol fees are distributed to holders, liquidity providing swap fees, and farming incentives. The governance token is also used to vote for liquidity incentives through snapshot proposals. In March 2022[2], Beethoven-x released their cutting edge technology, Boosted Pools. The amount of liquidity needed for daily trades is usually much less than what is deposited, leading to a lot of idle capital. Beethoven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boosted pools takes this idle capital and deposits it into revenue generating strategies to earn an omnipresent yield on the liquidity provided. Weighted investment pools turn the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Each pool can contain up to 8 different tokens, where each token is assigned a weight defining what fraction of the pool is made up by each asset. For certain assets that are expected to consistently trade at near parity (e.g. different varieties of stablecoins or synthetics), we utilize the StableSwap AMM as popularized by Curve.

Combining compliant CeFi with true DeFi elements, ChangeX looks to streamline the crypto experience for everyone. Built on the Hydra Chain, ChangeX launched on 19th July 2022 and they are introducing unique products like Leveraged Staking for up to 2x the APR, along with a Crypto Visa Card connected to POS Assets, Cross-Chain swaps, One Click Crypto to Fiat Trading and Personal IBAN via SEPA amongst other things. The average person on the street, will likely have heard about Bitcoin and the blockchain, but will they know about decentralized exchanges, liquidity mining, the concept of staking or automated market makers? The gap between the mainstream user and the ever accelerating pace of innovation is widening every day. This gap acts as a technological entry barrier, even for the majority of crypto holders (or interested audiences). ChangeX realizes that the step from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfiat banking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrypto ownership\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is only half the journey and that the hurdles from \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrypto ownership\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeFi participation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are equally significant. The philosophy of ChangeX is to act as a bridge between the blockchain and the end user by removing all entry barriers and offering a simple user experience. Read WhitePaper ChangeX will act as a bridge between the fiat and crypto worlds, making it easier for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional bank customers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to turn into \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrypto hodlers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then from \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrypto hodlers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to become true \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeFi participants\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. As a core product philosophy, ChangeX will incorporate elements of centralized finance to act as a simple and uncomplicated fiat gateway, offering a seamless mobile-first experience, which unlocks the power of DeFi in just a few clicks. 1. Truly non-custodial Multi-Chain Wallet The non-custodial Wallet uses the open-source and battle-tested TrustWallet as a fundament for the deposit and user wallet management. The user is in complete control of their assets. Your Keys, your Coins. The wallet has been launched while being able to support only BTC and a few HRC20 and ERC20 coins at the moment. This will be increased gradually as time progresses and will be able to store all You will be able to safely store all your ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standard NFTs inside the ChangeX app once this feature is launched 2. Hydra DEX Connectivity The ChangeX App is also connected to the Hydra DEX and has access to it\\'s Liquidity and a few pairs like Hydra / CHANGE and DAI / CHANGE (via Multihop). The remaining pairs will be added soon 3. Cross-Chain Crypto-to-Crypto Conversion Made possible by utilizing the power of DeFi Liquidity Pools. Direct buying and selling will be supported for all major crypto assets based on current best quote and without any hidden costs. Currently with a few pairs, namely CHANGE / HYDRA, CHANGE / BTC (Cross Chain), CHANGE / ETH (Cross Chain), CHANGE / DAI Soon we shall have One-click access to staking HYDRA and other PoS assets on other chains like Ethereum and Binance Chain to begin with. ChangeX is one of the first apps that designs leveraged positions for staking and liquidity mining products. You will be able to select your leverage in one click from inside the ChangeX app and enjoy a much higher APR, with up to 2x boost. This leveraged staking technology will create a bridge between the stablecoin lenders, the stakers, and the protocol block rewards, merging all involved parties for mutual benefit. A product focused on simplifying the conversion experience for first-time users An easy to use fiat-to-crypto conversion mechanism, which will enable EUR and USD transfers for direct purchases on virtual pairs that will be created through the use of DeFi liquidity pools. For instance, a HYDRA:EUR pair would be available by the utilization of a two-hop conversion: 1st hop: EUR-to-USDT via high liquidity exchanges such as Kraken; 2nd hop: USDT-to-HYDRA via existing liquidity (Kucoin, Gate.io or Hydra Dex). The users taking advantage of the fiat conversion product would avoid the process of opening exchange accounts and deal with order books and cross-exchange withdrawals/transfers. The user will also be automatically taking advantage of the highest liquidity on the market, as the exchange product will be optimized to utilize the lowest possible slippage Made possible by utilizing the power of DeFi Liquidity Pools. Direct buying and selling will be supported for all major crypto assets based on current best quote and without any hidden costs. Harnessing a basket of highly liquid assets ChangeX will provide its users the ability to deposit idle stablecoin assets into an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEarn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature for a fixed interest rate. This savings mechanism will distribute the deposited funds into DeFi products that offer appealing liquidity mining and inflationary mechanisms for stimulating growth. A bridge between stablecoins and PoS assets in the app. Margin accounts used for Leveraged Staking will require borrowing stablecoin assets and would in turn result in an attractive APR for the stablecoin lenders. The Leveraged Staking product being one-of-a-kind will technically create a bridge between stablecoins and the inflationary economy of PoS assets. In a successful scenario, and if demand for leveraged staking is high, that on its end would drive the demand for sustainable lending Dynamic spending on staked assets (no need to unstake) without impairing APR and without the need for cumbersome transfers in and out of multiple exchanges. Flexible staking in the ChangeX app will offer the ability to hold and stake assets while maintaining immediate access to them for day-to-day spending. You could stake HYDRA securely and be able to spend ad-hoc and wherever you need to. A Visa payment will micro transact the matching amount that is required for settlement and will liquidate it through the best possible liquidity sources. The ChangeX team\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive experience in running a fiat-to-crypto exchange, together with all relevant compliance and licensing frameworks, will be used as a fundament for obtaining an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license and bundling SEPA EUR bank accounts to all qualified users. The end goal is to have a personal IBAN as well as a wallet that you can trust on CHANGE is Deflationary and Multi-Chain. Everything that happens on the ChangeX app is centered towards utilization of the Change Token. CHANGE facilitates the DeFi products in the ChangeX platform which includes Leveraged staking pools &amp; trading pairs. Basically, all transactions in the app will interact with CHANGE causing an increase in Demand and APR, while reducing supply. Every new feature we add will ultimately be connected to the $CHANGE token, this only invites investors to hold the token and reap the rewards of its price action, while consistently enjoying various benefits just by holding and staking it. We believe that this is a good philosophy for future success and sustainable growth.

The APY currently stand at around 820% as of 14th August 2022, assuming the user re-stakes their earned rewards on a daily basis and is the APY displayed in-app. These rewards are allocated to the stakers on a real time basis and can be claimed at any time. After the 9 month staking reward pool is completed, and as explained above, the commissions charged to each staking pool for various tokens on different chains (e.g. HYDRA, CAKE, BNT staking pools) in the ChangeX app will be used to buy CHANGE. These purchased tokens are then distributed to the CHANGE token stakers as staking rewards. So, the more assets and the bigger the staking pools in the app, the higher the APR of $CHANGE, Thus creating a bridge between the staked inflationary assets and the deflationary economy of CHANGE An ICO was conducted between March and June of 2022 <br/> A crypto veteran team with a track record of three successful projects (Hydra Chain, LockTrip, Bitcoin Gold) undertook the development of this next-generation product that provides a seamless experience for unlocking crypto\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most powerful DeFi and CeFi features in combination with traditional banking with SEPA functionality and a Crypto Visa Card.

First conceived in January 2020 to prove that it\\'s possible to design an AMM that serves the needs of fee revenue-focused market makers better than Uniswap\\'s original constant product design. After a year in development, the protocol went live on April 2, 2021, allowing anyone to trade derivatives without counterparty risk while eliminating margin calls, liquidations and defaults for on-chain derivatives. The main features of the protocol are the latest Perpetual x5 Derivatives, Covered Call Options &amp; Unified USDC Pool for liquidity providers. CompliFi addresses the problem of unbounded potential payoffs, which cannot be fully collateralized upfront. It solves it by modifying all derivative payoffs to fit within a fixed collateral pool. Once this feature is baked into the payoff function, every instrument can be fully collateralized upfront and will never default. The risk arises because most regular derivatives have unbounded potential payoffs, which cannot be fully collateralized upfront. For instance, suppose you buy a synthetic leveraged token. If the underlying asset\\'s price keeps on rising, so does your payoff, and someone has to fund it. For that someone, there is no finite amount of collateral that could be posted upfront to guarantee coverage of their liabilities in every market scenario. A derivative involves multilateral promises of a payment contingent on the future state of the world. Making sure the losing side delivers on their promise is hard. In conventional finance, this job is done together by regulators, central counterparties, internal risk management departments and the judicial system. Associated costs run into hundreds of billions per year, yet we still get epic failures like the 2008 subprime crisis. Derivative protocols tend to manage counterparty risk but adopt a single technique from conventional finance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they ask users to post collateral that partially covers their potential downside, and if the downside starts to materialize, they ask users to post more. If users refuse, derivative positions are liquidated, and proceeds are used to cover the liabilities. When markets move slowly and there is plenty of block space to get collateral top-up transactions mined in time, the system tends to work. Problems begin when these conditions no longer hold: The risk arises because most regular derivatives have unbounded potential payoffs, which cannot be fully collateralized upfront. For instance, suppose you buy a synthetic leveraged token. If the underlying asset\\'s price keeps on rising, so does your payoff, and someone has to fund it. For that someone, there is no finite amount of collateral that could be posted upfront to guarantee coverage of their liabilities in every market scenario. CompliFi addresses this problem by modifying all derivative payoffs to fit within a fixed collateral pool, effectively \"cutting off\" the unbounded bits that cause all the trouble. What you get as a result are derivatives that look very much like their conventional counterparts but have a pre-determined floor and ceiling for how much the holder can gain/lose. Once this feature is baked into the payoff function, every instrument can be fully collateralized upfront and will never default. Automated market makers often serve a dual purpose in decentralized finance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to generate trading fees for liquidity providers and to rebalance their asset portfolios towards a pre-determined target composition. CompliFi proves that it is possible to design an AMM that serves the needs of fee revenue-focused market makers better than Uniswap\\'s original constant product design by decoupling terms of trade from market markers\\' inventory. Even in the most popular AMM pools, only a tiny fraction of assets is ever traded, while the rest lie idle and do not generate trading fees. For the market maker, that is an inefficient use of capital. CompliFi Protocol introduces its own AMM design that removes excess reserves from its pool, allowing it to affect its trading dynamics significantly. First announced on April 6, 2021, COMFI has a total supply of 10,000,000 tokens. COMFI has been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet but has not been connected to the protocol. As a result, COMFI does not currently allow its holders to participate in the governance of CompliFi directly or to benefit from revenue generated by the protocol. The upcoming CompliFi V2 lays the foundation for introducing governance &amp; revenue-generating mechanics. [1] CompliFi was the first protocol to introduce x5 Leveraged Tokens in DeFi that don\\'t experience margin calls, liquidations, or defaults. The mechanism allows anyone to take on leveraged exposure to anything, as long as it has a price feed on Ethereum. All tokens start with a nominal value (aka claim on collateral) of 1 USDC. Throughout its life, the token\\'s nominal value rises or falls at 5 times the rate of the underlying asset over the same period but within the corridor of 0\\xe2\\x80\\x932 USDC. Let\\'s consider ETHx5 as an example. The corresponding long-short token pair is ETHx5 Up and ETHx5 Down. The \"Up\" token multiplies the percentage change in ETH price by 5, and the \"Down\" token by -5. In other words, a 1% increase in the price of ETH would result in the nominal value of ETHx5 Up rising by 5%, at the expense of a corresponding decline in ETHx5 Down. If ETH falls by 1%, the situation is reversed. When ETH price hits + or -20%, one of the tokens will have a nominal value of 2 USDC and the other zero. These are the nominal value ceiling and floor \\xe2\\x80\\x94 nominal value of an x5 token can never go higher than 2 USDC, or below zero (i.e. you would never receive a margin call). [2] Market Value of the x5 Token Let\\'s suppose that you are sitting on a winning token with a 2 USDC nominal value, but you are a week away from the settlement. Its value cannot rise any higher, but it could go lower if markets change direction. As a result, you would struggle to find a rational buyer for your position at 2 USDC. However, you would likely find it much easier to sell it at a discount, giving the buyer some nominal value upside to look forward to. This rationale is what gives rise to the difference between a derivative\\'s nominal value and its market price. Calculating the size of that difference is where things get a little technical. In V2, x5 Leveraged Tokens gained a new feature, as they are now perpetual. Leveraging the same principles that underpin the x5 leveraged token, on Aug 14, 2021 CompliFi introduced a new instrument; Call Options. Like x5 products, Call Options do not pose default risk for traders. Long term investors providing liquidity to these instruments can see superior returns vs classical AMMs and lending protocols, thanks to premiums paid by options traders. [3] Unlike the x5 leveraged token, there is no cap on the call option payoff \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no matter how high the price of an asset goes, there is always enough collateral to cover it. This is because the option is collateralized by the same asset on which it is written (i.e. it is covered), and the USD value of collateral grows in line with the option payoff. x5 Products When you add liquidity to a CompliFi AMM pool, you receive LP tokens, just as you would on Uniswap. The basic economics is similar to other AMMs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when traders buy and sell derivatives, they pay trading fees, which accrue to LP token holders. Differences begin with CompliFi pool contents. All pools contain two assets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the x5 short and x5 long position tokens for the same derivative. This makes LP tokens largely market neutral \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when the long position decreases in value, the short position increases. Traders will buy derivatives from the pool and quantities of long and short tokens will no longer be equal, leading to market risk. CompliFi manages market risk in two ways: 1) exposure is never allowed to exceed pre-determined limits; 2) when a swap makes LP risk position worse, the AMM charges a higher trading fee for it. Call Options Unlike x5 products, there is no need to exit the position to stablecoins first or pair it up with another asset. The AMM pool will put your tokens to work, allowing traders to buy and sell their potential upside. For long term investors, providing options liquidity is a unique opportunity to put their capital to work, with prospects of superior returns vs classical AMMs and lending protocols. On the whole, the CompliFi AMM tries to make sure that, over time, you would do significantly better by providing options liquidity than keeping the tokens in your wallet. ", "Compound (also known as Compound Finance) is a lending protocol founded by Robert Leshner[1]. It was the first lending protocol to launch on Ethereum. The Compound Protocol allows users to borrow crypto assets, using any other supported asset as collateral. It launched in September 2018 and later raised $25m from a16z and Paradigm[2] in November 2019. The protocol is thought to have pioneered the tokenization of assets with cTokens[3], yield bearing tokens which can grow in value. In the summer of 2020 Compound started its liquidity mining program, giving out COMP token as an incentive for users to lend and borrow tokens on its platform. This incentive program attracted huge liquidity on the protocol and kickstarted the \"Defi summer\", which saw an enormous amount of liquidity poured over into DeFi. Later, more and more protocols followed with their liquidity mining programs to attract liquidity on their platform.

Farmers deposit their Curve LP tokens in Concentrator.\u00a0 Concentrator stakes those LP tokens in Convex vaults.\u00a0 Yields from those vaults are harvested, swapped to CRV and then staked on behalf of the farmer in the Convex CRV vault where they autocompound.\u00a0 Users may withdraw any or all of their deposit and yield at any time in CRV or (zap to) CVX or ETH. \u00a0 An autocompounder generally sells all farming rewards for a vault in order to buy more of the deposited token. The APY is generated by compounding the base rate, but the base rate for the yield is the same as that for the bulk deposit.\u00a0 Gains are realized continuously rather than at a time chosen by the farmer.

Convex allows Curve liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves. Liquidity providers can receive boosted CRV and liquidity mining rewards with minimal effort. If you would like to stake CRV, Convex lets users receive trading fees as well as a share of boosted CRV received by liquidity providers. This allows for a better balance between liquidity providers and CRV stakers as well as better capital efficiency. Convex has no withdrawal fees and minimal performance fees which is used to pay for gas and distributed to CVX stakers. CRV stakers and liquidity providers also receive liquidity mining rewards in the form of CVX. Convex rewards CRV stakers with a share of the boosted CRV on the Convex platform making it an ideal destination for those who wish to stake CRV whilst remaining liquid Convex allows liquidity providers to earn trading fees and claim boosted CRV without locking CRV themselves.

Cryptex\\xe2\\x80\\x99s vaults can be used for various strategies within DeFi, such as going long/short on minted tokens. Cryptex is fully decentralized and controlled by smart contracts and protocol governance. Cryptex launched in April of 2021. Cryptex has three cofounders, Preston Van Loon (founder of Prysmatic Labs), Joe Sticco, and Thomas Matzner. Cryptex is the first protocol that allows users to trade the entire crypto market cap, via the TCAP token. Cryptex launched TCAP and CTX governance coincidingly. Cryptex is a fair launch protocol with no ICO or VC\\'s and is fully decentralized. TCAP is the total crypto market cap token. When minted, this token represents the total crypto market cap, and fluctuates as the crypto market does. Cryptex uses a decentralized price feed from Chainlink to track the crypto market cap for their TCAP token. TCAP is a synthetic token, which can be minted with ETH, DAI, or other collateral options. TCAP is an overcollateralized asset, meaning users must lock up more collateral than the TCAP is worth. This offers a higher degree of safety for users of the protocol. TCAP can be held as an index for all of cryptocurrency, or it can be traded as a representation of the crypto market cap. Cryptex Finance is a decentralized protocol that is governed by the CTX token. CTX can be staked to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrypt Keepers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (protocol delegates), who make decisions on the future of the protocol. Protocol delegates are responsible for advising changes to the protocol, such as collateral options or setting liquidity rewards. All contracts on the Cryptex protocol have been audited by Quantstamp. ", "Curve Finance is a decentralized exchange created by Michael Egorov. It is currently the largest protocol by total value locked. The original white paper for Curve Finance was written on November 10th, 2019[1] and published on January 3rd, 2020. Curve Finance is a DAO governed by the CRV token which launched in August 2020. Curve Finance specializes in pegged assets such as stablecoins. The protocol is written using the Vyper programming language. The Curve Finance white paper, originally named StableSwap was written by Russian physicist, Michael Egorov on November 10th, 2019. The protocol launched a few weeks later on January 3rd, 2020[2] and grew organically to around $500,000 TVL within 10 days. At the time, Uniswap and Kyber were major players in the decentralized exchange space but neither protocols had native support for pegged assets which usually made it more expensive to trade such assets. The original pool had to be relaunched after a major vulnerability disclosure by Sam Sun[3]. Both original pools used yield-bearing tokens from Compound Finance after the suggestion was made by Compound Finance founder Robert Leshner. Curve smart contracts were subsequently audited by Trail of Bits and Sam Sun. Curve Finance third pool included ytokens, yield bearing tokens developed by Andre Cronje in early 2020 which later spawned Yearn Finance. Those yTokens would rebalance themselves to the lending protocol with the better yield (usually AAVE or Compound). In March 2020, a hacking attempt on the BUSD pool left it imbalanced causing panic among Curve Finance early liquidity providers. Andre Cronje was held responsible despite not profiting or causing the imbalance. He later announced he was leaving the DeFi community on the 3rd of March 2020[4][5]. In April, another bug related to a logic issue with the underlying rate of ytokens was discovered in a newly launched sUSD pool which lead to a shut down. No funds were lost but Curve Finance was seen as a riskier protocol which lead to a rework of security practices. In a bug disclosure, Michael Egorov said: \"Never deploy a pool with unaudited changes: no matter how small and obvious they are;\" [6] By early June, Curve Finance TVL had grown to over $25m in TVL with daily volumes as high as $47m. The team had grown to five people with the addition of Ben Hauser, a Vyper contributor who developed a testing framework for Ethereum called Brownie, Charlie Watkins who became the second employee, anonymous contributor Kendrick Llama and Taiwan based content creator Chris. The protocol also began supporting native Bitcoin swaps and deposits with the help of Ren Protocol with both protocols being widely credited for the advancement of Bitcoin on Ethereum. It was at the same time Kain Warwick of the Synthetix protocol suggested incentivizing the sUSD pool with the SNX token, a move that marked the creation of yield farming. In June, it was rumoured Curve Finance would transition to DAO with the help of the CRV token, a governance and utility token. The token launch happened on the 13th of August after an anonymous developer going by the name of the 0xc4ad took it upon himself[7] to develop the finalized contracts which had been finalized and made public days earlier on GitHub. A few hours later, Charlie Watkins announced the team would adopt 0xc4ad deployment[8]. CRV was immediately listed on Binance and other major exchanges. Around a week after the CRV launch, Curve Finance reached $1 billion in TVL and had long shedded its image of a risky protocol. In late September, Charlie Watkins introduced a proposal to start fee sharing between liquidity providers and token holders which was subsequently accepted by the Curve DAO.[9] Despite the controversial CRV launch, Curve grew rapidly in the following months and began being referred to as the backbone of DeFi yields as many protocols in the industry rely on the protocol.[10] It reached $10b TVL for the first time in June 2021.[11] In early February, Convex, a yield optimizer built atop and supported by Curve Finance launched and began growing rapidly accounting for around 90% of Curve Finance TVL on Ethereum[12]. The introduction of a bribing mechanism and the so-called \"Curve Wars\" allowing protocols to buy voting power from Convex and Curve Finance users to receive emissions from both protocols is largely credited as one of the reasons behind the protocol growth.[13] In 2021, as Ethereum grew more expensive to use, Curve Finance focused on leaner pool implementation as its original lending pools became too costly to use. It launched on its first sidechain in February 2021[14] as part of its long standing relation with Andre Cronje. It later launched on Polygon in April 2021[15]. In June 2021, as a major departure from the pegged assets space, the protocol launched a pool with volatile assets called tricrypto. In November 2021, more crypto pools appeared on Curve[16]. Curve Finance enables low-slippage swaps between stable assets using the algorithm described in its StableSwap whitepaper. Curve\\'s major use cases revolve around maintaining peg for stablecoins and wrapped assets (e.g., wrapped Bitcoin). Curve operates using pools, which group assets whose prices should be stable, and metapools, which group individual assets paired with an existing pool. Exchanges from one asset to another are routed through these pools. For example, the largest pool for stablecoins is 3pool, which holds DAI, USDC and USDT. To enable and incentivize liquidity for their asset, individual stablecoin issuers have created metapools that group their stablecoin (e.g., FRAX) with the 3pool. This allows stablecoins of varying liquidity access to the liquidity strength of three large and reputable assets. Curve v2 pools enable support for volatile assets using a different algorithm, described in its crypto pools whitepaper. The major volatile asset pool is tricrypto2, which holds USDT, wBTC and wETH. However, since Curve has allowed creation of crypto pools for any asset, protocols have mostly created pools that pair their assets with ETH or USDC rather than following the stablecoin pattern of pairing with a metapool like tricrypto2.

Liquidity pools for non-stable crypto-assets Uncollateralized borrowing for whitelisted market makers and institutional borrowers Algorithmically determined interest rates dAMM will launch with limited governance (see: Governance page), but will have several additional utilities: dAMM can be staked for a portion of protocol revenue. dAMM can be staked to vote on interest rate model and utilization rates of individual pools. dAMM can be staked to vote on future allocations of bdAMM on a pool by pool basis.

In August 2020, DIA raised 15$ million through the sale of its governance token.[1] Blockchains are networks that automatically perform transactions, also known as smart contracts, when certain conditions are met. But Blockchains are closed networks, natively only accessing internal data of the network to execute these smart contracts. Blockchain oracles are the third-party services that provide smart contracts with information from the outside world. If a blockchain oracle only relies on a single and centralized source of truth, it can lead to altering the smart contract, sacrificing the decentralized and trustless ness nature of Blockchain Networks and smart contracts. DIA is working towards solving the oracle problem by crowd-sourcing and validating data scraped from multiple sources.[2] The DIA platform claims to be designed to deliver financial data points with transparent methodologies by leveraging the community to source and validate data points.

The main feature of Dopex are SSOV (Single Staking Options Vaults), which allow exposure to Covered call and Cash-secured puts via selling on-chain options. Recently the protocol has added an OTC section which allows peer-to-peer options trading. Single staking options vaults are the main product offered by Dopex. They are, in fact, a vault in which a user can deposit funds to get exposed to covered calls and cash-secured puts strategies. The SSOV all use European options, which means the contract cannot be exercised before the expiring date. A call option is a contract between two parts which gives the buyer the option (but not the obligation) to purchase a set quantity of a certain asset to the seller at a certain price called the strike price for a premium (payed by the buyer to the seller). This vault takes advantage of the covered call strategy, which consists of selling out of the money call options while at the same time holding the underlying asset. This allows, if the option expires out of the money, to earn the premium while staying exposed to the underlying collateral. By depositing assets into this vault (ex. ETH into the ETH Call SSOV) one limits the upside gains on the underlying while earning a yield from the premiums. A put option is a contract between two parts which gives the buyer the option (but not the obligation) to sell a set quantity of a certain asset to the seller at a certain price called the strike price for a premium (payed by the buyer to the seller). This vault takes advantage of the cash-secured put strategy, which consists of selling out of the money put options while at the same time holding cash (AKA stablecoins). This allows, if the option expires out of the money, to earn the premium while holding stables. By depositing stablecoins into this vault (ex. USDC into the ETH Put SSOV) one earns a yield on USD provided the underlying asset price does not go below the strike price Since the introduction of SSOVs v3, multiple expiring timelines are possibile, allowing for monthly, weekly or even daily SSOV. It is also important to note that Dopex also offers protection from losses in the SSOVs. When SSOVs options expire in the money, part of the funds lost by the SSOV liquidity provider is paid back from the protocol in the form of rDPX tokens.

The goal of Fiat DAO is to be the first on chain repurchasing (repo) market for fixed income assets. A financial transaction is made in which one party (the user) deposits collateral with a promise to repurchase the collateral at a later date. Fiat DAO will enhance secondary market liquidity for cash markets such as fixed income assets like zero coupon bonds by acting as a market maker for the underlying in a capital efficient manner not currently available in decentralized finance. A healthy repo market makes available the necessary funds to allow the secondary markets to perform effectively. Investors of this asset class are thus able to efficiently and safely gain leverage and issuers are able to benefit from reduced funding costs. $FIAT itself stands for Fixed Income Asset Token which was developed as an instrument to represent an over collateralized claim against collateral deposited. Fiat DAO is the brainchild of a team of core contributors Nils, Johannes, Max and Daniel. Many of whom had been contributors of Barnbridge DAO and were intimately familar with the Smart Yield product utilizing senior and junior tranches that represent fixed and variable yield products. It was clear to the creators that the problem with fixed income assets like zero coupon bonds lies in the illiquid nature of the asset itself. Essentially there was no secondary market available in which the user could bring this class of asset to the lending market as collateral and develop leverage for fixed income. The lack of an available secondary market represents a lost opportunity cost until maturity of the asset. The founders recognized the problem of poor capital efficiency was not just an issue that exists at Barnbridge but a problem that exists across all of DeFI and also a problem that traditional finance has addressed already with the development of repo markets. So as a consequence, in the 4th quarter of 2021, seed investors and the core team had begun work to bridge this gap in DeFI and develop a repo market in DeFI that would allow fixed income to become a superfluid collateral at high LTV ratios not currently seen. At a high level, Fiat DAO consists of two ERC-20 tokens that represent both a governance token and an algoarithmic token that is minted against deposited collateral. The FDT token is our governance token which when staked in the DAO will allow participants to oversee direction and provide stewardship of the project. FIAT, as mentioned before, is essentially a claim against deposited collateral and looked upon as a floating token that is not net pegged to the dollar but instead will fluctuate with the prevailing discount rate. If $FIAT is trading above $1 then this will decrease both the collateral ratio and thus LTV and when $FIAT is trading below the $1 will in turn increase the collateral ratio and increase LTV. Because of the illiquid nature of fixed income assets, a rapid expansion or redemption of collateral at scale makes a floating \"stablecoin\" better suited for the fixed income market. Standard operation will allow users to bring fixed income assets to [Fiat DAOhttps://app.fiatdao.com/ Fiat DAO] and deposit them as collateral. This will allow the user to mint $FIAT at high LTV ratios. The minted $FIAT can then be deposited in another protocol providing for more fixed income to use as collateral. So now a leveraged loop for the purchasing of more of the underlying asset has been developed that can be again be used for minting of more $FIAT as positive sum re-leveraging. In this case there is no sell pressure on FIAT which could affect the loan to value ratios offered. Another scenario would allow users minting $FIAT to then use a DEX to exchange $FIAT for another stablecoin which can then be deposited into another fixed income asset as collateral to mint more $FIAT. Borrowing $FIAT establishes a debt position at a loan to value limit ratio (LTV) that will define the maximum amount of leverage to be obtained as well as a borrowing fee. Releveraging $FIAT in the secondary market is a powerful strategy for financially experienced users who are cautioned; if the prevailing market rate moves against them, they may experience a loss of collateral value. If the underlier price drops below a calculated threshold that the protocol cannot recover the users debt position then a liquidation is triggered. To assure no pernicious bad debt accrues, liquidation allows for the conversion of confiscated collateral to $FIAT to pay back the positions outstanding debt. The expectation is that outside market participants are incentivized to buy confiscated collateral at a discount to the prevailing market rate for profit. This can be particularly challenging given the fragmented nature of fixed income assets on the secondary market which not be liquidated as easily as say stablecoins. In essence $FIAT represents an over collateralized token which is minted against a users deposited collateral. It is not meant to be a replacement of stablecoins but rather provide a specialized lending market that represents the fixed income assets of stablecoins. This in turn will result in deeper liquidity as stablecoins become locked in fixed income assets thus providing for greater stability and increased circulation as minted FIAT is leveraged back into the underlying asset. Fiat DAO thus develops a symbiotic relationship with stablecoin issuers rather than an adversarial one. <br/> ", "An Interoperable Full-Stack DeFi Protocol on Neo There is a hard cap of 1 Billion FLM tokens, to be minted and released into circulation over the next 17 years.

", "The Flashstake protocol is a novel financial infrastructure that allows users to receive instant yield on deposited assets by locking up principal for a chosen duration. The protocol is made possible by Flash Strategies, which utilize underlying protocols such as AAVE, Yearn, etc. to generate yield. Strategies are yield generating vaults that contain arbitrary logic. They can be registered with the Flash Protocol smart contract if they adhere to the minimum requirements as laid out in our technical documentation. On a technical level, a strategy consists of a smart contract inheriting the Flash Strategy interface. It uses one or more DeFi protocols (e.g. AAVE, Convex\\xe2\\x80\\xa6) to stake a specific token (e.g. DAI, ETH\\xe2\\x80\\xa6). The Flash Protocol uses the strategy to instantly mint fTokens when staking. The registry of a new strategy in the Flashstake smart contract results in the creation of a strategy specific ERC20 token, called fToken. This token facilitates the conversion of any type of yield into fixed upfront yield, representing the future yield of the deposit An fToken is an ERC-20 token, created by the Flash protocol whenever a new strategy is registered. fTokens are specific to a given strategy and represents the yield pool. This means 100% of the total fToken supply can be redeemed for 100% of the total yield in a given strategy. Upon staking, it is possible for the user to mint a FlashNFT which will represent their stake. FlashNFT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s can also be created after the initial stake providing the Stake still has some number of Staked tokens. Strategy profits accumulate over time in a strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yield pool and can be claimed for upfront yield by burning fTokens against the strategy through the Strategy smart contract. The assets received are proportional to the relative ownership of that specific strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total fToken supply and the size of the yield pool. This means a user who holds 45% of the total fToken supply can burn and redeem these fTokens for 45% of all generated yield within the corresponding strategy. FlashBack allows users to choose some number of ERC-20 tokens and the duration they wish to stake for. These parameters are used to determine how many ERC-20 reward tokens are reserved for the Stake. The reward is always paid out at the end of the Stake. FlashBack stakes can be withdrawn at any point in time however if this is done before the staking period ends, all reward tokens are forfeited and only Staked tokens are returned.

Sam Kazemian created Frax in 2019 with former Federal Reserve Board nominee Stephen Moore. [1] Frax consists of two tokens, Frax the stable coin and FXS the governance token. Frax main points of interest: Fractional-Algorithmic, Decentralized &amp; Governance-minimized, Fully on-chain oracles, Two Tokens, Crypto Native CPI. Frax is a stablecoin with parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply algorithmic. This means FRAX have parts of its supply floating/unbacked. The stablecoin (FRAX) is named after the \"fractional-algorithmic\" stability mechanism. The ratio of collateralized and algorithmic depends on the market\\'s pricing of the FRAX stablecoin. If FRAX is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If FRAX is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio. Community governed and emphasizing a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management. Frax v1 uses Uniswap (ETH, USDT, USDC time-weighted average prices) and Chainlink (USD price) oracles. FRAX is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Frax Shares (FXS) is the governance token which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value. Frax\\'s end vision is to build the first crypto native version of the CPI called the Frax Price Index (FPI) governed by FXS holders (and other protocol tokens). FRAX is currently pegged to USD but aspires to become the first decentralized, permissionless native unit of account which holds standard of living stable.

Any token part of a Chainlink data feed can be lent to borrowers or used as collateral. Lenders are able to deposit ERC-20 assets into the pair and receive yield-bearing fTokens.\u00a0 As interest is earned, fTokens can be redeemed for ever-increasing amounts of the underlying asset. Fraxlend also supports the ability to create custom Term Sheets for over-the-counter debt structuring. Fraxlend Pairs can be created with features like: maturity dates, restricted borrowers &amp; lenders, under-collateralized loans, and limited liquidations. Lenders deposit Asset Tokens into the Pair and in return receive the corresponding number of Asset Shares (fTokens) depending on the current Share Price. At any time a Lender can exchange their fTokens for the underlying Asset Tokens at the rate given by the current price.\u00a0 The fToken Share Price increases as more interest is accrued. Accruing interest is the only operation which can change the Share Price.\u00a0 Because interest accrual is always positive, the number of Asset Tokens that each fToken is redeemable for cannot decrease.

Gearbox Protocol allows anyone to get leverage in a decentralized way and use it across various other protocols in a composable way: margin trading, leverage farming, and more One of the key aspects which actually makes this DeFi primitive possible are Credit Accounts, which \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbind\\xe2\\x80\\x9d together lenders and borrowers in this equation. More specifically, a Credit Account is an isolated smart contract that holds user + borrowed funds, has liquidation thresholds, and has a list of allowed tokens and protocols (in order to avoid attack vectors from malicious actors, like borrowing leverage and buying a self-created ERC20 token; or sending an operation to a malicious smart contract). A Credit Account is an isolated smart contract which contains both the user funds and the borrowed funds. This is where your leverage is. After you open an account, all the operations go through this account and the assets stay on it as well. You can see a Credit Account as your automated DeFi wallet where you not only keep positions, but can also potentially program it the way you want. Funds on Credit Accounts are used as collateral for debt, and users can operate these funds by sending financial orders to their Credit Accounts. That could be: margin trading on Uniswap or Sushiswap; leverage farming on Yearn; arbitraging pegged assets on Curve, and more! Diesel Tokens are like cTokens of Compound. These tokens automatically earn interest &amp; fees proportional to your share of the pool like cTokens on Compound or Yearn LP tokens.

", "GEIST[1] is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity market protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over collateralised (perpetually) or under collateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion. Geist Finance is a lending and borrowing market on Fantom based on one of the largest DeFi protocol AAVE. AAVE has grown to become one of the most respected and secure protocols in the space but Geist wants to do things differently. The Geist protocol has no governance and no VCs, instead it features a revenue earning token sharing platform fees between token holders and liquidity providers. The protocol will always be permissionless for everyone to use on the same basis. As GEIST has no governance or ownership, there is also no protocol treasury. Instead, 50% of the revenue generated through borrowing is distributed directly to users who stake GEIST. Both lenders and borrowers receive GEIST rewards to incentivize protocol use. GEIST liquidity mining employs a mechanism first introduced by Ellipsis Finance on BSC. Rewards are vested for 3 months, but may be claimed immediately for a 50% penalty. The penalty is then distributed to users who choose to lock GEIST for 3 months. This mechanism ensures steady rewards for those who actively commit to the protocol by locking their tokens. GEIST stakers receive protocol fees, GEIST lockers receive protocol fees as well as exit penalties from users who exit their vests early. Similar to the Ellipsis protocol, rewards are vested for three months. You can immediately receive your rewards by taking a 50% exit penalty if you do not wish to wait. During vesting, you can receive protocol fees, the same way you would if you staked GEIST. GEIST stakers receive 50% of protocol revenue. You can exit staking without a penalty whenever you wish. Just like staking, locking means you receive a share of protocol fees. Because you are committed to the Geist protocol by being locked for three months, you will also receive penalty fees from those exiting their vests early. You cannot exit a lock early.

GMX allows users to leverage trade various assets and contains stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, no price-impact trades, and staking for the platform\\'s utility and governance token. GMX started as Gambit Protocol, which was launched on Binance Smart Chain and initially focused on creating a partially backed stablecoin that automatically generated interest (USDG). Essentially, a stablecoin backed by leverage.[1] Gambit\\'s native token was GMT which had a whitelist presale in early March 2021.[2] Within three weeks of launching on mainnet, Gambit recorded $400m of volume and $380k in fees.[3] In June, the name GMX started to take shape after a proposal passed to merge all four different protocol tokens into a single token called GMX.[4][5] With this change, GMX (still named Gambit at this time) also removed the backed-by-leverage stablecoin aspect of the protocol. Instead of users providing liquidity to a whitelisted asset and receiving USDG in return, they will receive GLP. In August 2021, GMX posted a Medium article detailing the launch plans to Arbitrum.[6] The contracts were deployed in July, but Arbitrum had not yet opened to the public. The GMX trading platform launched on Arbitrum on September 1st, 2021. Within two weeks after launching GMX handled a volume of $150m and earned $300k in fees.[7] As of April 28th 2022, GMX has $341m total value locked (TVL). The three main tokens associated with GMX are GMX, esGMX, and GLP. GMX tokens are used for governance and can be staked for a share of swap and leverage fees. 30% of swap and leverage fees are converted to ETH on Arbitrum or AVAX on Avalanche and distributed to stakers of GMX tokens. [8] 70% of swap and leverage fees are distributed to GLP token holders in ETH on Arbitrum or AVAX on Avalanche. [9] GLP (GMX Liquidity Provider) tokens can be minted with any asset supported by GMX on the chain the user is interacting on and can be redeemed for any other asset in the pool. GLP token holders also earn esGMX (escrowed GMX rewards) which can be staked like GMX or vested to become GMX tokens over the course of a year.

For Grizzlies the bear market is not a threat but an opportunity. Grizzly.fi starts as a convenient Liquidity Mining Aggregator. Liquidity Mining enables investors to generate a steady stream of income in a bull and a bear market. The Aggregator launches on the Binance Smart Chain and will expand to other chains shortly after. The Grizzly Honey Token ($GHNY) is the native token of the Grizzly.fi platform. The token is paid out as a reward when generating profits on Grizzly.fi. The Grizzly Honey Token is closely coupled to the performance of the platform. You don\\'t need GHNY to participate but by staking it in the Honeypot you can participate in the growth of the platform. So you can gain profits not only with liquidity mining, but also through the ownership of Honey Token! However, the Honey Token is subject to price fluctuations and the value can rise and fall. In the Stablecoin Hives and the Mixed Hives, you can choose from the following 3 Strategies: All of your rewards are automatically re-invested into the two currencies of the hive, thus creating a daily compound effect. You don\\'t get any GHNYs. The majority of your rewards are automatically re-invested into the Hive, thus creating a daily compound effect. Part of your rewards are compensated in GHNY. The majority of your rewards is paid out in GHNY and automatically staked in the Honeypot, thus creating the highest returns when the Honey Token rises in price. ", "H2O is the first non-pegged stable asset for the Web3 Data Economy. Initially, it is backed by the OCEAN token but in Q3 it will also be backed by other next-generation data tokens. H2O serves as a medium of exchange and unit of account in data marketplaces. The governing token of the protocol is POSEIDON, which will be used to govern the initial parameters of the protocol, bootstrap ecosystem development, and incentivize the liquidity of the protocol. We see H2O becoming the dominant medium of exchange and unit of account for data tokens, and positioning itself as an integral part of decentralized data economies. The long term price trajectory of H2O is determined by the demand for OCEAN leverage. H2O tends to appreciate if SAFE users deleverage and/or H2O users long and it depreciates in case SAFE users leverage and/or H2O users short. To better understand how H2O behaves, we need to analyse its monetary policy which is made out of four elements: POSEIDON will be initially distributed as follows: ", "Hashflow is a decentralized exchange designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and MEV-protected trades. Hashflow uses DeFi-native RFQs to fetch quotes from market makers who are responsible for managing liquidity in the pools. Market makers are required to cryptographically sign quotes that remain unchanged for the duration of the trade. This ensures that the price is guaranteed and cannot be front-run or sandwich attacked. It also protects traders against slippage if there is significant price movement between the time it takes to validate the transaction on the source chain and relay the payload on to the destination chain. No, Hashflow is not a bridge. Hashflow does not require users to escrow their assets to mint wrapped assets on the destination chain. Instead, Hashflow allows users to swap natively across chains without the need for a bridge. Most chains should take anywhere between 3-6 minutes except for Polygon. Because Polygon reorgs happen far more frequently compared to other chains, we currently need to wait for 500 block confirmations before initiating the transaction on the destination chain. As a result, selling an asset on Polygon will take approximately 15-20 minutes.

Anyone in the Indexed community who owns at least 1 NDX can create a proposal. On October 14th 2021, Indexed was exploited for $16m from their indices DEFI5 and CC10.[2][3]The beta for Indexed launched on December 25th, 2020.[4] Staking for the NDX governance token began on December 28th.[5] The DEFI5 (DEFI Top 5) and CC10 (Cryptocurrency Top 10) indices launched on January 17th, 2021.[6][7] On February 12th, Indexed reached a peak TVL of $71.42m.[8] Indexed announced the ORCL5 (Oracle Top 5) Index on February 17th which would contain Chainlink, UMA, Band Protocol, Oraichain, and API3.[9] The first NDX community index launched on March 1st, DEGEN.[10] If any of the protocols in this index surpassed $2b it would be automatically replaced with the largest market cap token on a list of pre-approved alternatives. At launch, the index contained: <i>Pre-approved alternatives at launch</i>: Sushi ($SUSHI), KeeperDAO ($ROOK), API3 ($API3), Hegic ($HEGIC), Perpetual Protocol ($PERP), Alliance Block (ALBT), Keep3rV1 ($KP3R), Axie Infinity ($AXS), 88mph ($MPH), dHEDGE DAO ($DHT), Whiteheart ($WHITE), Cover Protocol ($COVER), OctoFi ($OCTO), Synlev ($SYN). The protocol announced an NFT platform index at the end of March. NFTP would contain the following tokens to start[11]: In May, Indexed announced the Future Of Finance Fund. FFF was made up of three NDX index pools (DEFI5, DEGEN, and CC10) alongside WETH and WBTC.[12] On September 25th, NDX launched dividend-bearing NDX (dNDX) which would allow NDX holders to receive the revenue generated by the protocol.[13] The revenue is generated from exit fees, 0.5%, when a user decides to leave one of the index pools. For every $100 generated in revenue, $40 would be sent to the NDX Treasury and $60 would be distributed to holders of nNDX.[14] October 14th 2021 was when the Indexed Finance exploit occurred. An address funded by the mixing service Tornado Cash launched a flash loan exploit to impact the weights of assets in certain index pools.[15] Within a week of the exploit, the Indexed Finance team already had a suspect. After looking at previous messages, Doctor Day (a founder of Indexed) and the team believed they uncovered the identity of the exploiter.[16] In the ensuing months, NDX and the alleged exploiter had a public feud on Twitter. See: https://twitter.com/ZetaZeroes The exploiter was eventually traced back to a doxxed email account associated with Andean Medjedovic, who was also named in a class action lawsuit organized by the Indexed team.[17] In late December, a warrant for Andean\\'s arrest was issued.[18] As of April 30th, 2022 he has not been found. The NDX token architecture is forked from the UNI token.[19] The token allows holders to add/remove tokens from indices, adjust fees and reserve ratios of vaults, spending the Indexed DAO treasury, and more.  The index pools are all associated with index tokens. Not to be confused with Indexed\\'s governance token NDX, the index tokens represent a fractional ownership of the assets in different index pools.[20] For example, DEFI5 is the index token that represents the DEFI Top 5 index pool. The assets inside of index pools are weighted based on a variety of factors. Each pool has a current constituent list and then a secondary list that is essentially waiting to be put in the pool if an asset falls outside of a given pools parameters. The Indexed DAO doesn\\'t own the underlying assets of any index pool as they are kept within Balancer pools. The ownership of the underlying assets is strictly for the users redeeming their index tokens for the underlying assets.Index pools maintain balance by incentivizing users to adjust the token balances and weights on their own. The weight adjustments create arbitrage opportunities for users and achieve a balancing effect on the pools. Since NDX is essentially a modification of Balancer, swaps effect the balances and weights of the tokens. The value of pools are extrapolated using the first token with this function: <code>total_value = token_balance * total_weight / token_weight</code> A key aspect of the weight is that it can only change by ~1% per hour.[21] This creates a temporary discrepancy which can be manipulated. In the CC10 (Cryptocurrency Top 10) Index Pool by NDX, UNI was the first token. The exploiter took multiple flash loans and bought out UNI from the CC10 pool. The balance of UNI became very low very fast, but the weight is only allowed to change by 1%. This decreased the extrapolated-value due to the delay. With the manipulated value of the pool, the attacker initialized Sushi as a new token in the pool. SUSHI was heavily weighted in the pool due to the low extrapolated-value of UNI, essentially overvaluing SUSHI and allowing the exploiter to mint an excessive amount of index-tokens, such as DEFI5 and CC10. These were cashed out for the underlying assets in their respective index pools for a total of $16M.[22] <i>Credit to the following resources</i>: Mudit Gupta\\'s Twitter thread,[23] rekt news article,[24] and Indexed Finance\\'s Post-Mortem.[25] ", "Infy is decentralized Lending and Renting Protocol for NFTs. It is imperative that you understand that this is the minimum number of days that your NFT can be rented out for by someone else. Therefore, be careful not to set it for too long, and it must be lower than the Maximum Lend Duration It is imperative that you understand that this is the maximum number of days that your NFT can be rented out for by someone else.And it must be higher than the Minimum Lend Duration. Therefore, be careful not to set it for too long and, because if the floor price of the NFT rises, the renter may choose to not return the NFT. Think of lending as selling a call contract with a strike price of the collateral. If the floor price during the rent goes up to 2 ETH and you have set the collateral price at 1 ETH, then there is obviously a profit of 1 ETH for the renter.Therefore, it is important to actively monitor the market and update your lending when required. Another good way to manage this risk is to set a small max lend duration, such that it is less likely that the floor price goes up during the rent. How much the renter will pay you per day for renting the NFT. The payments are accrued per second. If you return the NFT earlier, the correct amounts will be compensated back to you. Keep in mind, that when renter rents, they will pay both the full amount of rent, as well as collateral. This will go into the INFYLend contract for escrow. Also note, due to the design of the contract, the numbers are limited to 4 decimal places for both the borrow price and the collateral. Also, note, that the whole number cannot exceed 4 digits.

A little over 2 weeks later, Klima announced the LBP details on their Medium.[2] As described on this Medium: A Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool is an adjustable balancer smart contract designed to distribute tokens fairly across market participants. LBPs use constant selling pressure and have a limited time duration, during which price continually drops when there is no demand. By using an LBP, Klima DAO can define parameters (such as pool weights and total available supply) and allow the market to converge on a fair price for the token as demand emerges. The LBP started on September 14th and ended September 17th. The sale started at approximately $116, reached a bottom of $57.58, and ended at $323.47. 95% of the tokens sold out, and Klima raised 17.47m USDC.[3] KLIMA went live on Polygon mainnet October 18th, 2021.[4] The initial launch was delayed by a few hours as someone created a rogue liquidity pair for BCT-KLIMA.[5] Someone acquired BCT ahead of time and made a pool with very low liquidity, and it led to BCT rising in price to $1,600. The team could not set up a second pool for the token on SushiSwap, so they had to sell directly into the low-liquidity pool to lower the price and add enough liquidity to make the pair tradeable. Bridging Carbon Credits on-chain Regenerative projects in the real world help remove the greenhouse gases from the atmosphere using reforestation and other regenerative techniques. These projects create an equivalent amount of Carbon credits available on the market through a verification process agreed upon by the voluntary market. These carbon credits are then tradable and are utilized by large companies to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing them off the market. Thus, indirectly funding these projects. However, the current carbon market lacks the liquidity to sustain efficient trading. Toucan Protocol is a web3 project which provides the infrastructure to bring these off-chain Carbon Credits over to the blockchain. Like we have bridges to send crypto tokens between L1s or L2 blockchains, the Toucan protocol acts as a bridge between the real and blockchain worlds. Users or projects can bridge their Carbon Credits after undergoing the verification and validation process by Verra. Verra ensures valid tokenization and that the real-world carbon credits are retired forever to avoid duplication and malpractices.  Known on-chain tokens for Carbon Credits BCT: Toucan Base Carbon Tonne NCT: Nature Carbon Tonne MCO2: MOSS Carbon Credit Token  Bonding Klima DAO uses the bonding mechanism from Olympus DAO; that is, they provide $Klima at a discount to anyone who bonds their on-chain carbon credits with their protocol. The users get cheaper $KLIMA, and the protocol grows their treasury of Carbon Credits which is used to back the value of the Klima token. Intrinsically, the value of 1 $KLIMA token is 1 unit of Carbon Credit, but because there is no cap to how high the price can rise, the value of $KLIMA is up to the market.  Staking $KLIMA holders can stake their tokens to earn an agreed-upon APY from the DAO voting. The staked KLima token is $sKLIMA, which rebases as per the APY. The broader goal of Klima is to become a \"Blackhole for Carbon Credits.\" The DAO\\'s treasury promises to lock in the bonded Carbon, which helps raise the prices of Carbon Credits in the market. Higher costs to obtain Carbon Credits would subsequently cause companies and organizations to work on reducing their carbon footprint instead of just offsetting them. As of 24th, April 2022, 6 months from their launch, Klima DAO has retired 17,254,395 units of Carbon from the market.

", "Lemma is a protocol built on Arbitrum that offers a basis trading vault and a decentralized stablecoin, called USDL, backed by arbitrage opportunities. Users can deposit assets into Lemma Basis Trading Vault or they can use them as collateral to mint USDL. When a user deposits assets into the Basis Trading Vault, the protocol uses these assets to mint and stake USDL, while the user receives xUSDL (staked USDL) in return.[1] USDL maintains peg through arbitrage. If the price of USDL drops below its $1 peg, ideally rational actors would buy as much USDL as possible, and then redeem each USDL for $1 USD worth of assets. If the price were to rise above its $1 peg, ideally rational actors would mint as much USDL as possible (since 1 USDL can always be minted for $1 worth of assets), and sell the newly minted USDL for assets on the spot market.[2] Users can mint USDL and exchange USDL for $1 USD at all times as each USDL is backed by a \"synthetic USD\".[3] Each USDL is fully collateralized by a \"synthetic USD\", which are created by Lemma using market neutral positions.[4] When a user deposits assets into Lemma, Lemma moves the assets to a decentralized derivatives exchange. The protocol uses these assets as collateral and opens a short perpetual position. If users only want to mint a stablecoin, USDL corresponding to the value of the deposited assets is issued to the user. If the user wants to use the basis trading vault and earn yield, then the minted USDL is staked to access profits and losses from funding rate payments (the user receives xUSDL in return which reflects these profits and losses.)[5] For example, if a user deposits $1000 worth of ETH, Lemma will create a portfolio of 1000 \"synthetic USD\" on their behalf, and mint 1000 USDL to represent the user\\'s stake in the overall Lemma \"synthetic USD\" portfolio. The protocol uses the users deposit as collateral to enter into a corresponding short Perpetual Future position on a derivative exchange. If the price of ETH increases by $100, the users long position (the ETH that the user holds which was deposited into the protocol) increases by $100 as well. At the same time, the worth of the short position (the short Perpetual Future opened by Lemma once the user deposited) will decrease by $100. Therefore, the total change to the position and the value of the users \"synthetic USD\" is 0, meaning that each USDL is backed by a market neutral position.[6][7] USDC, USDT and ETH can be used deposited to mint USDL.[8] If users deposit USDC, Lemma will sell this USDC for ETH, using 1inch.[9] When a user deposits assets in the basis trading vault, Lemma uses those assets to automatically mint and stake USDL on their behalf. In return, they receive xUSDL (the staked version of USDL) that increases and decreases in value with the yield produced. The Basis Trading Vault earns yield through funding rate payments, earned through the short perpetual position opened upon users\\' deposits. Only users that stake their USDL are exposed to the profits and losses of the trading, while every USDL is always used to generate yield and returns through funding payments. Therefore, USDL stakers are exposed to the profits and losses of both their own USDL and the unstaked USDL. When users deposit assets into the basis trading vault, they receive xUSDL (staked USDL) in return. That xUSDL represents the user\\'s principal (deposited assets converted to USDL) plus the PnL (profits and losses) from the basis trading returns on: their principal + a proportional amount of unstaked USDL. There is currently an 8 hour delay after users initiate unstaking for their xUSDL.[10] Lemma will issue LEMMA tokens to manage governance for the stablecoin. Holders of the token will be able to set risk parameters, prioritize the roadmap and propose new features.[11] Yield gained through the Basis Trading Vault will be used to fund the treasury/insurance fund. Initially, 30% of profits will be allocated. These will be used to increase the security of the stablecoin and mitigate risks. yield towards the treasury/insurance fund will help increase the security of the stablecoin &amp; help mitigate some of the risks mentioned in the next section.[12] If there exists a critical bug in the smart contract written by Lemma or the underlying derivative exchange, user funds may be lost and USDL may be undercollateralized.[13][14] If funding rates are negative for a prolonged period, this could lead to risks for both USDL and Basis Trading Vault users.[15] If a large number of users withdraw their assets from the Basis Trading Vault but keep their assets in USDL, this could lead to increased \"leverage\" for remaining Basis Trading Vault Users. This increased risk could lead to increased losses for remaining users of the Basis Trading Vault, since all Basis Trading Vault users are exposed to the profits and losses for all USDL (not just those that are staked).[16] Stablecoin users\\' are exposed to the risk of not being able to redeem their USDL for 1 USD worth of cryptocurrency, if there was a prolonged period of negative funding payments that emptied the treasury/insurance fund and there were no assets in the Basis Trading Vault.[17] Website: https://www.lemma.finance/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/LemmaFinance Docs: https://docs.lemma.finance/ ", "Lido DAO is a community that builds liquid staking services.

", "Liquity is a smart contract lending service enabling users to take out over-collateralized loans by locking ETH as collateral to borrow LUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Once generated, LUSD can serve diverse usage: a hedge against volatility, a tool to get leverage on ETH, or even access yields through DeFi applications. Launched in April 2021, the platform grew to a total value locked of $1.15 billion as of April 2022.[1] The service provided by Liquity is similar to MakerDAO, but the protocol has several specificities, the main one being that Liquity and LUSD are fully unstoppable: the services are enabled thanks to smart contracts that have no administrative functions. It means that just like Uniswap, the Liquity protocol cannot be modified in any way and will operate as long as the Ethereum network synchronizes. The LUSD stablecoin is a decentralized, unstoppable, and collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. LUSD is created when users borrow against locked collateral. LUSD tokens are destroyed upon repayment, freeing a corresponding amount of the underlying collateral. Liquity is only a borrowing service: there are no lenders. Instead, the protocol itself acts as the counter party of the borrow, just like with MakerDAO. The only token accepted as collateral on Liquity is Ether (ETH). While it is restricting, it also allows the protocol to avoid frequent trustlessness pitfalls observed in other decentralized stablecoins, such as DAI or FRAX, whose majority of the collateral backing them are centralized and censurable stablecoins such as USDC. The fee structure on Liquity differs from the usual interest rate charged to borrowers on Maker or Aave. Instead, Liquity provides interest-free borrowing: a unique one-time borrowing fee is paid while minting LUSD. The base fee is 0.50% of the borrowed amount. However, this figure can dynamically increase to preserve the protocol\\'s equilibrium during periods with large demands for LUSD minting or redemptions.[2] Since Liquity provides interest-free borrowing, it is particularly cost-effective for long-term positions. Borrowing on Liquity can serve various use-cases, including: The primary source of liquidity for LUSD is the LUSD/3pool on Curve.[3] It has a corresponding Yearn Vault, and it\\'s also available through Convex. LUSD is also available in the Saddle D4 pool, along with alUSD, FEI and FRAX.[4] Finally, DAOs such as the OlympusDAO also took interest in LUSD: its desirable resiliency draw the DAO to accumulate it as an alternative reserve asset. Thanks to bonds, about 12 millions LUSD are part of the OHM/LUSD SushiSwap pool (Olympus protocol owned liquidity). OlympusDAO also owns about 23 millions LUSD staked in the Stability Pool.[5] Holders of LUSD can also earn LQTY yields by depositing in the Stability Pool detailed in the next section. The troves are the equivalent of MakerDAO\\'s vaults. It\\'s the contract enabling the user to lock its ETH in order to borrow LUSD. While the protocol is operating normally, a minimal collateralization ratio of 110% is required, meaning users can borrow at max about 90% of the value of their ETH in LUSD. When a given troves goes below a collateralization ratio of 110% (or 150% in Recovery Mode), it can be liquidated. Troves can be managed by end-user directly through one of the several Liquity front-ends. However, Liquity is also supported by service providers such as DeFiSaver[6] or InstaDapp[7], enabling users to conveniently manage their troves and set up automated strategies to avoid liquidations. Liquidations are a control mechanism triggered when needed to ensure the entire LUSD stablecoin supply remains fully backed by sufficient collateral. Troves that fall under a minimal collateralization ratio of 110% (or 150% in recovery mode) can be liquidated. The funds of the Stability Pool (&gt;300M LUSD as of April 2022) are critical in this operation. Here is a rough outline of the procedure The Stability Pool serves as a liquidity backstop for the protocol. It\\'s a pool made of LUSD deposited by users and used to ensure liquidations can happen when needed. Users staking LUSD in the Stability Pool earn a yield in LQTY, Liquity\\'s native token. During a liquidation, the debt of the Trove is canceled and absorbed by the Stability Pool, and its collateral is distributed among its suppliers. Therefore, over time Stability Pool depositors lose a pro-rata share of their LUSD deposits, while gaining a pro-rata share of the liquidated collateral (ETH). The Recovery Mode is an extreme measure and a deterrent to ensure borrowers behave responsibly. It is triggered when the Total Collateral Ratio (of the whole platform = all troves) goes below 150%. Once the Recovery Mode is triggered, any safe below a collateralization ratio of 150% can be liquidated. During recovery mode, user actions are restricted: any trove-related action that lowers the collateralization ratio below 150% is blocked. New troves can only be opened if they have a ratio &gt;150% and 0% borrowing fees.[8] The Recovery Mode is an emergency mechanism and not a desirable state for the system. Its purpose is to restore the collateralization level of the whole platform to a sustainable range. The Recovery Mode also acts self-negating deterrent: the possibility of it occurring actually guides the system away from ever reaching it. So far, the Recovery Mode was triggered only once during the ETH flash crash that occurred May 19th 2021. 189 Troves were liquidated during the triggering of the Recovery Mode for a total of 93.5M of LUSD debt offset and 48 668 ETH earned by Stability Pool depositors. A detailed post-mortem of the event is available on the Liquity\\'s blog.[9] Redemption is an arbitrage mechanism helping to maintain the soft peg of LUSD when it\\'s below $1. It enables users to exchange LUSD for ETH at face value, as if 1 LUSD is exactly worth $1. A minimum fee of 0.5% is charged on redemptions and it can increase when there is a lot of demand for either redemption or borrowing, as the \"baseRate\" raises up. The redemption fee is paid to LQTY stakers. Redemptions are a system-wide mechanism. When a user redeems, the ETH is taken from the lowest collateralized troves on Liquity. The corresponding amount of LUSD debt for the affected troves is burned. To avoid being redeemed against, a Trove user should make sure to keep a collateralization ratio superior to his peers. The oracle (price feed) is the source of truth used by lending services to determine whether or not a position is sufficiently collateralized. Since the system makes decisions based on this information, it is critical. With Liquity the base situation is even harsher because the code is immutable, meaning that the oracle too cannot be changed. To address this while maximizing the resiliency of the protocol, Liquity implements a dual oracle mechanism with a fallback logic. The base oracle is the Chainlink ETH/USD price feed[10]. However, there is a fallback to the Tellor ETH/USD price feed[11] if the following three (extreme) conditions are met: To maximize the decentralization and resilience of the protocol, the Liquity team does not operate the front-end of the application itself. Instead, the team provided a front-end launch kit and a front-end SDK enabling third parties to host and run front-ends for the Liquity protocol. To incentivize the endeavor, front-end operators can set up a kickback rate which capture a share of the LQTY earned by their users depositing into the Stability Pool. Most front-end operators set up the kickback rate to 90% at least, and often to 99%, meaning the capture only 1 to 10% of the LQTY earned by their users. A list of the front-end and their kickback rates is available on the Liquity website. The LQTY token is not a governance token: since Liquity\\'s contract are immutable there is no need for governance. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system and incentivizes early adopters and frontend operators. The total supply of LQTY is 100 000 000. Additional details about the token allocation can be found in Liquity\\'s introduction post. LQTY is earned by supplying LUSD to the Stability Pool or by front-end operators facilitating this operation. During the first 6 weeks of the service, LP of the Uniswap LUSD/ETH also earned LQTY.

", "Maker is a smart contract lending platform that allows users to take out over-collateralized loans by locking-in collateral like Ether in exchange for Dai, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. Once generated, Dai can be used as an hedge against volatility, a tool to get leverage on your collateral, or get yield through decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The platform has enjoyed widespread adoption and is among the largest decentralized lending platform with around $14.12 billion in total value locked (TVL), as of April 2022. Founded in 2014 by Rune Christen, the earliest prototype of the Dai stablecoin was announced in a Reddit post dating back to March 2015. In December 2017, the first formal white paper was published about MakerDAO, introducing theMaker governance token (MKR) and its first stablecoin known as Single Collateral Dai (SAI). The white paper described how anyone could generate Dai using Maker by leveraging Ethereum (ETH) as collateral through unique smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs). Given that ETH was the only collateral asset accepted by the system, the Dai generated was called Single-Collateral Dai (SCD), or Sai. The white paper also included a plan to upgrade the system to support multiple collateral asset types in addition to ETH. This upgrade was subsequently executed in November 2019. The Dai Stablecoin System, today called the Maker Protocol, now accepts as collateral any Ethereum-based asset that has been approved by MKR holders, who also vote on corresponding Risk Parameters for each collateral asset. Voting is a critical component of the Maker decentralized governance process. The Dai stablecoin is a decentralized, collateral-backed cryptocurrency soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Dai is created when users borrow against locked collateral, and it is destroyed when loans are repaid. If you deposit Ether or other cryptocurrencies accepted as collateral, you will create a new Dai. When you pay back the borrowed Dai, the locked collateral will be recovered. [1] Users generate Dai by depositing collateral assets into Maker Vaults within the Maker Protocol. To reduce volatility risk, crypto-backed stablecoins like Dai are usually over-collateralized. This meant that instead of a 1:1 ratio backing, the ratio could be 1:2. Currently you could mint Dai for the value of up to 70% of your ETH. [2] Every Dai in circulation is directly backed by excess collateral, meaning that the value of the collateral is higher than the value of the Dai debt, and all Dai transactions are publicly viewable on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is generated, backed, and kept stable through collateral assets that are deposited into Maker Vaults on the Maker Protocol. A collateral asset is a digital asset that MKR holders have voted to accept into the Protocol. To generate Dai, the Maker Protocol accepts as collateral any Ethereum-based asset that has been approved by MKR holders. MKR holders must also approve specific, corresponding Risk Parameters for each accepted collateral (e.g., more stable assets might get more lenient Risk Parameters, while more risky assets could get stricter Risk Parameters). Detailed information on Risk Parameters is below. These and other decisions of MKR holders are made through the Maker decentralized governance process.[3] In March 2020 the stability of Dai was questioned during extreme market volatility, to mitigate liquidity risk there was a proposal drafted to onboard USDC as collateral. USDC is a stablecoin backed by dollars held in a bank account, and supported by several institutions including Coinbase and Circle. However critiques have questioned adding USDC as collateral as it would make Dai less decentralized with banks backing the Dai stablecoin.[4] With the proposal to add USDC it opened the way for more fiat-backed stablecoins to be added. In July 2020, an upgrade to the Compound lending protocol caused Dai to come of its peg again. This was already anticipated but resulted in a proposal to add other stablecoins like Gemini USD, Binance USD and increase the systems debt ceiling. This development made the backing of Dai partially dependent on centralized actors thus making Dai less decentralized. The Maker Protocol is one of the largest DApps on the Ethereum blockchain. Designed by a group of contributors, including developers within the Maker Foundation, its outside partners, and other persons and entities, it is the first decentralized finance (DeFi) application to see significant adoption. The Maker Protocol is managed by people around the world who hold its governance token, MKR. Through a system of scientific governance involving Executive Voting and Governance Polling, MKR holders govern the Protocol and the financial risks of Dai to ensure its stability, transparency, and efficiency. One MKR token locked in a voting contract equals one vote. The Maker token has two core functions: i) governance and ii) recapitalization. In terms of governance, MKR token holders are responsible for monitoring, participating, and voting on proposals or changes to ensure the overall health of the Maker protocol. This is done via two types of polls which are executed through smart contracts: i) proposal polling and ii) executive polling. The former is used to gauge the consensus of the Maker community towards a proposed change. It is a preliminary step, conducted to ensure that proposals are well thought out before formal voting begins in executive polling. In that stage, MKR holders officially vote to approve or disapprove a proposal. The smart contract address which receives the highest number of MKR tokens is then elected as the active proposal. Further details on polls can be found in Maker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whitepaper. Some examples of changes that have been proposed or implemented in the protocol are: adding a new collateral asset, modifying the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), choosing a set of oracle feeds and upgrading the Maker contract\\xe2\\x80\\x99s functionality. Users can view all current and previous polls, as well as their outcomes, on Maker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s governance page. \u00a0 The second function of the MKR token is recapitalization. In the event that system debt exceeds surplus, additional MKR tokens are minted by the protocol and sold for Dai through debt auctions to help bring the ecosystem back from insolvency. On the other hand, if system surplus exceeds debt, the protocol sells Dai via a surplus auction for MKR, which is subsequently burned. This mechanism incentivizes MKR holders to keep the system running as intended; bad governance will result in MKR value dilution and vice versa. More information on recapitalization can be found in Maker DAO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community development page, while auctions are elaborated on here.

The minting of mAssets is decentralized and is undertaken by users throughout the network by opening a position and depositing collateral. Mirror ensures that there is always sufficient collateral within the protocol to cover mAssets, and also manages markets for mAssets by listing them on Terraswap against UST. MIR tokens have a variety of functions on the Mirror Protocol. The first and foremost functionality of the token allows holders to participate in governance on the protocol.

The earlier version of AMM forces LPs to allocate capital on the price range of (0, \\xe2\\x88\\x9e). This is wasteful because a large part of the liquidity will never be put into service, as token price will very unlikely jump to extremely high or fall to zero during your time of providing liquidity. Concentrated liquidity was introduced in UNI V3, and Muffin inherits the same design. LPs can concentrate their capital into their selected price range and therefore provide a greater level of liquidity, without the need to allocate capital outside the selected price ranges. In other words, it makes LP\\'s capital more efficient. Under the hood, each fee tier of a pool acts like an \"inner pool\", and has its independent price and liquidity. LPs allocate liquidity by selecting a fee tier and a price range \\xe2\\x80\\x94 similar UX to UNI v3. The most significant difference is LPs are now given more fee tiers to choose from. Let\\'s say a limit-range-order position is going to be fully converted to its target token at $1. And, in AMM, every swap is a price impact. So, when a swap moves the price to reach $1, the protocol will \"settle\" the limit-range-order position within the swap, as if the LP withdraws the liquidity in the same transaction alongside the swap. After that, the positions\\' liquidity will not be put into service again even if the price moves backward. Internal accounts are for Muffin\\'s users to store any ERC-20 tokens inside Muffin\\'s contract, instead of storing them in their own wallets.

It leverages Anchor protocol to offer a yield on the assets used as collateral on Anchor. The main offerings of Nexus are vaults. These are smart contracts in which an user deposits an asset which can be used on Anchor as collateral (ex. bETH, bLUNA) and earns a yield through the following strategy: The protocol aims to keep a constant LTV to avoid liquidation, so it rebalances the amount of UST borrowed as the asset price fluctuates. Depositing into a vault mints a nTOKEN (ex. nLUNA, nETH), which represents the claim on the collateral deposited into the vault. Holding a nTOKEN automatically accrues PSI reward into your wallet. While you can get a yield just by holding nTOKENs, you can also put them into liquidity pools (paired with PSI) to earn trading fees and even more PSI tokens. It is also possible to provide liquidity for the PSI/UST pair. Nexus currently also allows for deposit from the Ethereum blockchain, automatically bridging ETH to Terra.

We leverage an optimistic mechanism. There are no validators, and there is no blockchain. We\\'re deployed as smart contracts between two chains, and has a lightweight off-chain component. This allows us to have less overhead and be more cost-efficient than other interoperability protocols. Nomad enables applications to send data between chains and rollups. Applications interact with Nomad core contracts to enqueue messages to be sent, after which off-chain agents verify and ferry these messages between chains. In order to ensure that message-passing is secure, Nomad uses an optimistic verification mechanism, inspired by fraud-proof based designs like optimistic rollups. This makes Nomad more secure, cheaper, and easier to deploy compared to validator / proof-of-stake based interoperability protocols. The Nomad protocol consists of two core components, on-chain smart contracts and off-chain agents: Developers need not interface with off-chain agents directly, as the core contracts enforce logic around optimistic verification and ensure messages are securely transmitted. Nomad uses an optimistic verification mechanism, which is patterned after optimistic systems. It sees an attestation of some data, and accepts it as valid after a timer elapses. While the timer is running, honest participants (ie. Watchers) have a chance to respond to the attestation and submit fraud proofs. ", "Olympus is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on creating a decentralized reserve currency for Web3. Olympus popularized protocol owned liquidity and created a bonding marketplace called Olympus <i>Pro.</i> The project has spawned over 100 forks.[1] Olympus has been the subject of both fervent support and criticism.[2] On February 1st, 2021 a Medium article was posted, \"Introducing OlympusDAO, An Algorithmic Currency Protocol.\"[3] Shortly after this article, the protocol also introduced themselves on Twitter. The token ticker was initially OLY but then changed to OHM.[4] The founder of Olympus is pseudonymously known as Zeus. The protocol reached a peak TVL of $866.53 million in December of 2021.[5] The Initial Discord Offering (IDO) for the Olympus token, $OHM, was announced on March 2nd, 2021.[6] The only requirement was to be in the Olympus Discord prior to March 3rd at 03:00 UTC. The launch sale took place from March 12th 03:00 UTC to March 14th 15:00 UTC. Public trading of the $OHM token opened on March 14th at 18:00 UTC. On June 9th of 2021, Olympus announced a partnership with Frax. [7] In the same month, Olympus migrated to Version 1.1 to enable new functionality and features.[8] In July 2021, Olympus launched Ohmie-Cards which garnered widespread use on crypto twitter. [9] On September 17th of 2021, Olympus launched Olympus Pro; a bonding marketplace for protocols to build-up their own Protocol Owned Liquidity.[10] The next month, Olympus announced the upcoming V2 migration[11] that would eventually take place in December 2021.[12] On December 30th, 2021 Jordi Alexander posted an article arguing why, in his opinion, OHM was a ponzi scheme.[13] Nevertheless, a lot of counterarguments where brought to the table. [14] By January, Olympus was down 90+% from all-time-highs and general sentiment around the project was grim.[15] The price-decline was mostly attributed to cascading liquidations.[16] By July, Olympus has been able to outperform the market leaders (both BTC and ETH) for several months in a row. This behavior has been possible thanks to the activation of inverse bonds and the initiaton of the stability phase. [17] Olympus is as a reserve currency that is backed by a treasury of assets. This differs from a stablecoin as it is not pegged. Olympus uses staking, bonding, and treasury mechanics to achieve a desired outcome. Users stake OHM on the Olympus website and opt in to participate in the Olympus network. Staking OHM burns it, and users receive sOHM (staked OHM) in return. When unstaking, the sOHM is burned and the user receives OHM. Staking allows the user to receive OHM-rebase rewards every 2,200 Ethereum Blocks.[18] Olympus created the (3, 3) meme to refer to the optimal game theory of all users staking. The original APYs offered for staking were so high that it became a crypto twitter meme and Olympus made a website for users to easily meme their APYs.[19] With the goal of being a currency, there needs to be a lot of supply. Bonders can start bonding with any Olympus-approved digital asset and they\\'re promised a fixed return at a set point in time; the return is in OHM.[20] Bonding allows Olympus (and other protocols with Olympus Pro) to own their own liquidity. Olympus introduced Inverse Bonds in March of 2022[21] which introduce a mechanism to essentially allow users to redeem their OHM for treasury assets. The Olympus treasury consists of Treasury Reserves, Protocol Owned Liquidity, and locked, vesting, or other strategic assets.[22] Olympus also uses their treasury to act as an incubator for new projects through Olympus Incubator. Volt Protocol is the first Olympus Incubator project. ", "The first integrated peer-to-pool and peer-to-peer NFT lending protocol built on top of Aave OpenSky Finance is the first integrated peer-to-pool and peer-to-peer NFT lending protocol built on top of aave.com. Lenders enjoy 100% capital efficiency, earning from Aave, Instant loans and Bespoke loans.\u00a0 Instant loan borrowers can borrow immediately based on the floor price of their whitelisted NFTs. Bespoke borrowers can borrow flexibly if they want to borrow more with special whitelisted NFTs.\u00a0 Instant borrowers need not worry about forced liquidation since an Instant loan can only be liquidated if the borrower fails to take action to modify or repay the loan when it is due. Lenders deposit their ETH or USDC into an OpenSky EARN vault and start earning AAVE deposit income and Instant loan interest immediately.\u00a0 The deposits can be withdrawn anytime.\u00a0 No specialized NFT knowledge is required to earn safe and capital-efficient passive income. Borrowers stake their whitelisted collection NFTs, such as BAYC, and can borrow instantly based on a percentage of the floor price.\u00a0 The loans have a fixed interest rate and due date and can be repaid early without penalty.\u00a0 OpenSky is the first NFT lending protocol to offer peer-to-pool loans with no liquidation risk based on the NFT floor price.\u00a0 The borrower can not be liquidated unless they fail to modify or repay their loan by the expiry of the grace period (initially set to 48 hours subject to DAO vote) at the end of the predetermined loan term. Borrowers can make a loan offer for an NFT that is not on the Instant loan whitelist or for a high value NFT (such as Alien Punk) that is part of a whitelisted collection, such as CryptoPunks. Initially, only certain NFT collections will be whitelisted for Bespoke loans, but later this will be opened up to DAO voting. Lenders select the desired borrow amount, term, and APR. Lenders can see the listed Bespoke loan offers and use their Aave pool deposits to accept offers on a first-come, first-served basis. This is highly capital-efficient because the pool deposits keep earning until a Bespoke offer is made. Also, when a Bespoke loan is repaid, the funds are paid back to the Aave pool and the lenders start receiving the Instant loan income without interruption. OpenSky Finance is the first NFT lending protocol to eliminate price-based liquidation for peer-to-pool loans. As long as the borrower takes action to repay or modify (i.e. extend) the loan during the 2-day grace period when the loan matures, they will maintain control of their pledged NFT. In the rare instance of the borrower failing to take action on time, the NFT loan will be repaid by the OpenSkyDAO and the NFT will be transferred to the OpenSkyDAO Treasury where it will remain as an investment until OpenSkyDAO members vote on how to dispose of the acquired NFT assets. The Bespoke loan liquidation mechanism is very straightforward. A borrower makes a Bespoke NFT loan offer and a single lender funds the loan using their pool deposits. If the borrower does not repay the loan back to the lending pool when it is due, the NFT will automatically be transferred to the Bespoke lender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wallet by the OpenSky smart contract. This process works very similar to NFTfi. OpenSky Finance will send repayment reminders to minimize the risk of forgetting to repay the loan on schedule, but the borrowers are ultimately responsible to manage their loans to retain ownership of the pledged NFTs.

", "Origin Dollar (OUSD) is a new stablecoin that was initially launched in September 2020 on the Ethereum network. Its design is superior to existing stablecoins because OUSD captures competitive yields while being passively held in wallets OUSD generates yields by deploying the underlying stablecoins that were deposited to the OUSD smart contract to other DeFi protocols such as Compound, Aave, and Curve. There may be new diversified strategies added to the vault in the future. Collected interest, trading fees, and rewards tokens are pooled and converted to stablecoins to produce OUSD-denominated yields. Over time, the protocol will move assets in and out of different liquidity pools in order to provide the best yield to the holders of OUSD. The generated returns are passed on to the holders of OUSD via constant rebasing of the money supply. OUSD constantly adjusts the money supply in response to the yield the protocol has generated. This allows the price of OUSD to stay pegged at $1 while the balances in token holders\\' wallets adjust in real-time to reflect yields that have been earned by the protocol. ", "Osmosis, an advanced automated market maker (AMM) protocol that allows developers to build customized AMMs with sovereign liquidity pools. Built using the Cosmos SDK, Osmosis utilizes Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) to enable cross-chain transactions. Osmosis was founded by Osmosis Labs founders Sunny Aggarwal and Josh Lee. Upon raising $21 million in an October 2021 token sale, Osmosis has generated a loyal core of users and established itself as a core feature within the Cosmos ecosystem. Most major AMMs limit the changeable parameters of liquidity pools. For example, Uniswap only allows the creation of a two-token pool of equal ratio with the swap fee of 0.3%. The simplicity of Uniswap protocol allowed quick onboarding of the average user that previously had little to no experience in market making. The tools Osmosis provides allow the market participants to self-identify opportunities and allow them to react by adjusting the various parameters. An optimal equilibrium between fee and liquidity can be reached through autonomous experiments and iterations, rather than setting a centrally planned \\'most acceptable compromise\\' value. This extends the addressable market for AMMs and bonding curves beyond simple token swaps, as a limitation on the customizability of liquidity pools may have been the inhibiting factor for more experimental use-cases of AMMs. In Osmosis, the liquidity pool shares are not only used to calculate the fractional ownership of a liquidity pool, but also the right to participate in the strategic decision making of the liquidity pool as well. To incentivize long-term liquidity commitment, shares must be locked up for an extended period. Longer-term commitments are awarded by additional voting power / additional liquidity mining revenue. The long-term liquidity commitment by the liquidity providers prevents the impact of potential vampire attacks, where ownership of the shares is delegated and potentially used to migrate liquidity to an external AMM. This provides equity of power amongst liquidity providers, where those with greater skin in the game are given their rightful power to steer the strategic direction of its pool in proportion to the risk they are taking with their assets. The number and complexity of decentralized financial products are consistently increasing. Instruments such as pegged assets, derivatives, options, and tokenized leveraged positions each have their own characteristics that produce optimal market efficiency when paired with the correct bonding curve. That being said, the traditional notion of AMMs has evolved around putting the AMM first, and the financial product being traded second. As AMMs substantially increase the market accessibility for these instruments, assets with diverse characteristics either had to: To solve this issue, Osmosis introduces the idea of an \\'AMM as a serviced infrastructure\\'. Fairly often, adjustment of the value function and a few additional parameters are all that\\'s needed to provide a highly-efficient, highly-accessible AMM for the majority of decentralized financial instruments. By providing the ability for the creator of the pool to simply define the bonding curve value function and reuse the majority of the key AMM infrastructure, the barrier to creating a tailor-made and efficient automated market maker can be reduced The OSMO token is a governance token that allows staked token holders to decide the future of the protocol, including every implementation detail. OSMO will initially be used for the following (although governance is free to add or remove these functions): Governance is the critical component of how Osmosis evolves. Active stakeholders of the network will be responsible for proposing, vetting, and passing protocol upgrades. The pools eligible for liquidity rewards will be selected by OSMO governance participants, allowing the stakeholders to formulate an incentivization strategy that best aligns with the long-term interests of the protocol. While OSMO will initially function as both a governance token and a staking token, Osmosis intends to transition into a Cosmos Hub shared security zone as soon as the feature is ready.

Pyth also held its first own workshop in Chicago for developers looking to learn more about Pyth and building on top of it (January 17-21, 2022). Outside of DeFi, Pyth was a platinum sponsor at the 2022 FIA Boca Conference in Florida (March 15-17). On August 1, 2022, the Pyth network officially announced Pythnet, a network built on the Solana codebase that enables the Pyth network to aggregate first-party data at sub-second speeds and deliver pricing to other chains via the Wormhole cross-chain messaging protocol. Pythnet allows Pyth to take the next step in its evolution by adding new financial data and continuing to grow its network of high-quality first-party data providers. These additional high-fidelity feeds will be available on other chains, including Solana, via the Wormhole protocol. Thanks to Pythnet, Pyth Network price feeds are now live on: Total Value Secured (TVS): represents the aggregate amount of Total Value Locked (TVL) within all protocols and platforms that depend on the proper operation of an oracle network to operate. Total Value Locked (TVL): represents the number of assets that are being staked in a specific protocol at the moment: this value is not meant to show the number of outstanding loans, but rather the total amount of underlying supply that is being secured by a specific protocol or application by DeFi completely. Blockchain oracles act as the bridge between smart contracts living on a blockchain and real-world data. They are designed to relay information from off-chain sources (data outside a blockchain) to an on-chain network. In most cases, the off-chain data is used to trigger smart contracts that need external data to execute.[5] Borrow-Lending protocols, such as Solend, rely on oracle price feeds to determine the value of the underlying collaterals supplied and/or borrowed. Whenever the collateral provided is worth less than 1 + x% (usually x = 30) of the borrowed collateral, borrow-lending platforms must liquidate a user\\'s position to keep the overall platform healthy (enough collateral to repay the outstanding debt). Consider a single stock, say TSLA. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the price of TSLA?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a seemingly simple question, but there are subtle complications. Overall, there is no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone single price\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for TSLA at any moment in time. There is the best bid price (the price a person could currently sell TSLA at) and the best ask price (the price a person could now buy TSLA at). They are typically close together, but the difference between them (the so-called bid-ask spread) could indeed be viewed as the uncertainty of what the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of TSLA currently is, with the midpoint (halfway between the best bid and best ask) being an estimate of the price itself. Another \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that could be considered the proper price is actual transaction prices. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast traded price\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is a price that is often reported, and especially in a thinly traded stock, might be even more representative of the true price than the current best bid and best ask prices (where the bid-ask spread might be very wide).[6] In scientific and engineering fields, observation or measurement is almost always accompanied by a measurement of uncertainty. The distance between two points might be measured to be 10.12m +/- 0.01m. The time it took for a car to travel that distance might be 1.23s +/- 0.05s. The measurement of uncertainty is the observer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best estimate of how far off from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d value their measurement is likely to be, given the precision of their measuring equipment, the difficulty in making the measurement, and potentially other factors the observer deems important. Pyth extends the concept of measurement uncertainty to asset prices with its Confidence Interval (discussed below).[6] Financial applications requires high-fidelity, time-sensitive, real-world data, which has historically been inaccessible on-chain. High-fidelity in this context means accurately reporting data in a timely fashion. Contemporary music science introduced the concept of high-fidelity to audiophiles by demonstrating the importance of minimizing all distortions in sound reproduction. Simply put, sound engineers focused on reproducing music accurately (with more granularity) on new digital mediums. 3 different types of stakeholders will interact within the network: Publishers must stake PYTH tokens to participate in the protocol and earn a share of the rewards. Publishers earn a share of the data fees for the products they price. The data fees paid for a product will likely grow in proportion to consumer usage of the price feed. Publishing erroneous data (voluntarily or not) to the network may lead to the publisher\\'s stake being slashed. Consumers are incentivized to pay data fees for two reasons. First, data fees enable applications to reduce the risk of using Pyth price feeds as they would receive a payout in case of failure. Second, paying data fees attracts more publishers to the product, which improves the robustness of the price feed. Consumers will be able to pay a fee to the Pyth protocol in any governance-approved token, which may include PYTH, USDC, or other tokens. Delegators are incentivized to participate in the protocol to earn data fees (coming from consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 data fees). The Pyth protocol consists of 4 on-chain core mechanisms: The purpose of this process is to verify that the Pyth aggregate price and confidence interval for a product were incorrect in comparison to some ground-truth off-chain data. The process will use the HUMAN Protocol to collect the necessary off-chain information from impartial judges, then feeds that information into a predetermined algorithm that determines the outcome of the claim. [7] The Human judges\\xe2\\x80\\x99 role is not to answer yes or no the claim is valid but rather to report several pieces of (public) information: The claim will be successful if (1) the price feed published an aggregate price during the claim interval, and if (2) the published aggregate price, incorporating any uncertainty provided by the confidence interval, disagrees with the reference prices. The algorithm for comparing the prices constructs two ranges. The Pyth network price range extends from the minimum aggregate price minus 3 confidence intervals to the maximum aggregate price plus 3 confidence intervals. The Human price range extends from the reference exchange with the lowest reported price to the one with the highest reported price. The claim is successful if these two ranges do not overlap \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this indicates that the Pyth aggregate price and confidence are highly improbable according to these reference exchange. If the claim is successful, the algorithm will then additionally identify a set of at-fault publishers, slash their stake, and then redistribute it to paying end-users according to the share of fees they paid. The algorithm identifies at-fault publishers using the same algorithm applied to the publisher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s price and confidence instead of the aggregate price and confidence. <u>Example:</u> Let\\'s assume the following values were submitted by publishers and returned by the Pyth smart contract on a specific time for BTC/USD.  <i>Note that 1,000 is an unusually wide confidence interval for bitcoin. The typical confidence interval is ~50 (0.1%).</i> <i>Reminder that the Pyth network price range extends from the minimum aggregate price minus 3 confidence intervals to the maximum aggregate price plus 3 confidence intervals.</i> So the Pyth price range extends from 47,750 to 52,250. Now, let\\'s assume the Pyth Governance selected Coinbase and Binance as the reference exchanges for any BTC/USD claim and the Human job returns the following values.  <i>Reminder that the Human Protocol price range extends from the lowest reference exchange reported price to the highest reference exchange reported price.</i> So the Human Protocol price range extends from 46,500 to 47,300. In this case, the Pyth range ($47,750 to $52,250) does not overlap with the Human range ($46,500 to $47,300). Therefore this claim is valid and we now look for the at-fault publishers.  Pyth Publishers A &amp; B do not overlap with the Human Protocol range, their stake is slashed and paid out to voluntarily paying users. Pyth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98main product\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is its set of live price feeds. Find all the price feeds available on the Pyth network website. Each feed admits to the following features: Pythnet is an application-specific blockchain operated by Pyth\\'s data providers. This blockchain is a computation substrate to securely combine the data provider\\'s prices into a single aggregate price for each Pyth price feed. Pythnet forms the core of Pyth\\'s off-chain price feeds that serve all blockchains (except Solana mainnet). Pythnet is powered by Solana technology: it runs the same validator software, but is a separate network that is specially configured to be a proof-of-authority chain. The network depends on a tightly controlled supply of the chain\\'s native token, called PGAS, which is currently controlled by the Pyth Data Association. Operating a validator on the network requires a large stake of PGAS tokens. The Pyth Data Association allows each data provider to operate one validator by delegating them the necessary stake. Each data provider is then given a sufficient quantity of PGAS tokens to publish prices to the network. The network is configured such that account creation is very expensive, preventing anyone without a substantial quantity of PGAS from deploying programs to the network. Once governance is live, it will take over management of the PGAS token from the Pyth Data Association. Pythnet allows the network to scale with tremendous efficiency and a highly performant uptime. Read more about Pythnet here Pyth needs a cross-chain component to ferry prices on Pythnet to target chains. Pyth Network uses a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpull\\xe2\\x80\\x9d update model for target chain prices: instead of continually pushing updates to each target chain, users pull the prices on-chain when they are needed. This pull model is highly scalable and allows Pyth Network to deliver high-frequency price updates for a large number of products without overwhelming the transaction capacity of target chains (or incurring excessive gas fees). Data providers publish their prices on Pythnet. The on-chain aggregation program then aggregates prices for a feed to obtain the aggregate price and confidence. Next, the attester program regularly attests to the most recently observed Pyth prices and creates a Wormhole message to be sent to the Wormhole contract on Pythnet. The Wormhole guardians then observe the attestation message and create a signed VAA for the message. The price service API continually listens to Wormhole for Pyth price update messages. It stores the latest update message in memory and exposes HTTP and websocket APIs for retrieving the latest update. (Anyone can run an instance of this webservice, but the Pyth Data Association runs a public instance for convenience.) When a user wants to use a Pyth price in a transaction, they retrieve the latest update message (a signed VAA) from the price service and submit it in their transaction. The target chain Pyth contract will verify the validity of the price update message and, if it is valid, store the new price in its on-chain storage. Thanks to Pythnet, Pyth Network is able to expand to other blockchains with minimum friction. Users in other ecosystems can enjoy high-frequency and high-fidelity price updates on many types of assets ranging from crypto, equities, FX, and precious metals. Read more about Pyth cross-chain here The Pyth network is made up of proprietary (first-party) data providers that contribute their data (inputs) on-chain to the Pyth program and create derived outputs. By having a diverse group of data publishers, ranging from exchanges (US accredited or Crypto) to trading firms and other financial services providers, the Pyth network creates a completely new composite market data stream at quality levels previously inaccessible. There are more than 75 publicly announced data providers. The full list of publishers can be found on the Pyth website here. Pyth data is now available on for users on Ethereum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Solana, Aptos, Aurora and off-chain. Accordingly, Pyth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data is permissionlessly queryable (i.e. no paywall exists on the blockchain). The Pyth team will not know who is using the price feeds unless the person tells them (due to the permissionless nature of a blockchain). As of November 2022, there are 100 identified Pyth integrations on Ethereum, Optimism, BNB Chain, Solana, Aptos, Aurora and off-chain. Pyth users vary in types but usually offer the following services: borrow-lending, synthetics, derivatives trading, options vaults, and more. <br/> Notable Pyth users: Ethereum Optimism BNB Chain Solana Aptos Aurora With many more broadcasted on Pyth website.

", "Reflexer is a platform, where anyone can use their ETH collateral to mint RAI stablecoin. Unlike DAI and other stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, RAI is only backed by ETH, meaning it is unpegged. People can use RAI as an hedge against volatility, get leverage on their ETH collateral, get yield through decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, or take advantage of it\\'s floating target price (for example, through arbitrage). Reflexer was founded in 2020 by Stefan Ionescu and Ameen Soleimani. The idea behind Reflexer and RAI came from the DAI Purple Paper, which was written by a couple of MakerDAO team members, that hints to the fact that DAI was not supposed to be pegged to anything. Rather, it was meant to have a floating target price (aka moving peg) that changes according to what the market price of DAI is on secondary markets. RAI was launched on mainnet on February 17th, 2021 and drew inspiration from the early days of stablecoins to offer crypto-native stability completely detached from traditional finance and the U.S. dollar. RAI is an ETH backed, non-pegged stable asset, whose monetary policy is managed by an on-chain, autonomous controller. The further the market price of RAI moves from the target price, the more powerful the interest rate, and the greater the incentive for arbitrageurs to return RAI to equilibrium. The FLX token has two main functions inside the RAI protocol: GEB is the framework used to create stablecoins such as RAI. It is a modified fork of MakerDAO MCD, although it has several new features such as the possibility to add insurance for user positions, the option to add a lender of first resort, an on-chain treasury that incentivizes keepers to update core contracts, an on-chain PID, fixed discount auctions and other.

The vault reinvests the yield earned back into the strategy, effectively compounding the yields for depositors over time. The Theta Vaults run two options strategies to generate yields: Currently, funds held in Theta Vaults do not generate any yield, aside from writing options. Every Friday, the vault converts 100% of its USDC balance into yvUSDC by depositing USDC into the Yearn USDC yVault. This helps depositors gain exposure to the yield generated from Yearn on top of the options strategy. https://docs.ribbon.finance/faq ", "Roaring Lion is the first toxic deer fork on Binance Smart Chain, with fluid economy algorithmic stablecoins such as Serenity Capital. Inspired by both the protocol comes Roaring Lion, the best of both. Roaring Lions, $LION token value is algorithmically pegged to the price of Dai via seigniorage at a rate of 1 LION:1 DAI. When $LION price is over the peg, new $LION is minted by the protocol to inflate the supply, in an attempt to drive the price down towards the peg. These new $LION are placed into circulation through the Lionsden (boardroom) and distributed to $LSHARE/DAI LP holders staking it there. This increases the demand for $LSHARE, thus increasing the price and value of $LSHARE. With the all new 70/30 LP ratio for creates an extra 20% demand for $LSHARE.\u00a0 \u00a0 When $LION price drops below the peg, the protocol will allow minting $LBONDS with $LIONS (up to a maximum debt limit). This removes $LION from the total supply, applying upward pressure on the price towards the peg. $LBONDS can then be redeemed for LION at a premium when the price is above peg i.e. 1.01 TWAP. Farms are the only manner which investor can acquire $LSHARE. Roaring Lions native farms are held on Aequinox Exchange (our official DEX partner). Aequinox is a Balancer Dex which lets Roaring Lion offer new Liquidity Pool Ratio for its farms.

SCREAM provides peer-to-peer lending solutions that are fully decentralized, transparent and non-custodial. SCREAM aims to build high-velocity markets for more traditional crypto-asset lending services, but with the goal of improving overall capital-efficiency across a wider range of Fantom-based assets. Similar to (and based-from) existing lending platforms like Compound Finance, Aave and C.R.E.A.M. Finance, users will be able to lend any supported assets on our money markets, and use their capital as collateral to borrow supported assets. SCREAM aims to offer one of the highest liquidity platforms on Fantom. By offering money markets with the highest liquidity at launch, and aligning our incentives strategies with these markets, we believe users can obtain the highest value from its inception. SCREAM will introduce additional money markets, including stablecoins (e.g. FUSD); DeFi tokens (e.g. YFI, SUSHI, CRV, SNX); LP-tokens, and other major markets. The monetary value of the SCREAM token is nil. No expectation of profit should be affiliated with purchasing the SCREAM token at any time. The SCREAM token does not provide any share of profits and token holders should not expect any profit. SCREAM tokens do not contain any voting power that would provide the holder with any voting power. Nor does holding SCREAM token generate any passive income or profit share that may be attributed from other lending platforms. Reserves are an accounting entry in each scToken contract that represents a portion of historical interest (set aside as cash) which can be withdrawn or transferred through the protocol\\'s governance (once this is enabled). A small portion of borrower interest accrues into the protocol, determined by the reserve factor. The reserve factor is the percentage of interest paid to the SCREAM protocol. If the reserve factor is 10, then that would imply a 10% rate of interest paid on the borrowed asset allocated to SCREAM. scTokens have a collateral factor that can range from between 0-90%, and represents the proportionate increase in liquidity (borrow limit) that an account receives by minting the scToken. Large or liquid assets tend to have high collateral factors; whereas smaller or more illiquid assets will tend to have lower collateral factors. If an asset has a 0% collateral factor, it cannot be used as collateral (or seized in a forced liquidation event). However, the asset can still be borrowed. In summary, the Collateral Factor is the maximum you can borrow against a particular asset. SCREAM has integrated ScLoans into its Fantom money markets. ScLoans are developer tools that provide access to undercollateralized loans, pending the borrowed amount (and fee) that is returned within one transaction block on the network. ScLoans will offer a wide range of use cases, including arbitrage and collateral swapping opportunities, and interest rate swapping. ScLoans derive from Aave Flash Loans, except ScLoans are implemented on Scream\\'s lending token, scToken. Similar to C.R.E.A.M.

The premise for Silo\\'s design is the recognition of pre-existing lending marks such as Aave and Compound which utilize a shared-pool model where any whitelisted collateral can borrow any other token deposited into the platform. The danger of this approach is that exploits in any single asset can be used to drain the protocol as a whole, irrespective of what asset lenders originally deposited. From the perspective of lenders in these money market designs, the security of a shared-pool is only as strong as its weakest asset. A flow-on effect is that shared-pool models must be highly judicious in which assets they are able to list, with assets deemed unsafe due to low on-chain liquidity or unsuitable oracles unable to be listed. This creates a scenario where these long-tail assets cannot have money markets created for them in an effective manner. Silo\\'s design isolates all money markets into \"siloes\" which consist of one base asset and the bridge assets only, with the bridge assets being XAI (Silo\\'s stablecoin) or ETH which are used as an intermediary to allow capital to flow between siloes. Since only onebase asset can be used as collateral per silo, an exploit in silo A cannot affect lenders in silo B since Token A cannot be used in silo B. In doing so, lenders\\' risk exposure is limited to the bridge asset only and not to base assets in other silos. This notion allows Silo to create money markets for virtually any asset as the listing of additional tokens does not incur additional risk at a protocol level and in future will not require governance to create markets for new assets. Rather, risk is controlled at a silo level by bridge lenders who can control which non-bridge asset they are willing to take risk on from. The Silo Protocol consists of numerous isolated lending markets called \"silos\" that consist of one base asset and the bridge assets only. For a holder of $ABC that wants to borrow $XAI (one of the bridge assets), they <i>must</i> deposit $ABC into the $ABC silo to borrow $XAI - they cannot deposit $ABC into, say, the $XYZ silo since the $XYZ silo only accepts $XYZ as collateral and not $ABC. This means that if $ABC experiences an exploit, since it can only be used as collateral in its respective silo, $XYZ lenders in the $XYZ silo (or any silo for that matter) do not take on any additional risk. Instead, the party at risk is bridge lenders in the $XYZ silo who have explicitly chosen to deposit the bridge asset(s) into the $XYZ silo. This means that risk is controlled at a user level, as bridge lenders are able to select which asset to be exposed to by actively depositing into its respective silo. This differs from shared-pool lending markets where risk is controlled at a protocol level by governance voters. Since risk is isolated to individual silos, Silo has the benefit of creating lending markets for virtually any asset as additional asset listings do not confer any extra risk to the protocol as a whole. This makes Silo the ideal money market for long-tail assets that are deemed to be unsafe to shared-pool markets that have systemic risk by design. Users can deposit base assets into their respective silo. For example, if you are holding $AURA, you can only deposit it into the $AURA silo and not any other silo. Since every silo also consists of the bridge asset, this means the bridge assets can be deposited into any silo. When you deposit an asset, you are able to use it as collateral. This allows you to borrow any other asset from that same silo. Depositors also have the ability to allow their deposit to be lent out (borrowable) or not lent out (protected). Borrowable deposits will accrue interest to lenders which is paid by borrowers based on Silo\\'s interest rate model. Protected deposits cannot be lent out and do not accrue interest but allow the depositor to use it as collateral. In order to borrow, users must first deposit assets as collateral into the silo they wish to borrow from as either a borrowable or protected deposit. When you are borrowing an asset, you will accrue interest payable every block which is added to your outstanding debt position, with interest rates derived by Silo\\'s interest rate model. In order to close your borrow position and withdraw your deposit, you must repay your initial borrowing plus any interest accrued for the duration of the borrow period. Since Silo\\'s markets are isolated by design, to borrow $XYZ using $ABC, the borrower must utilize the bridge asset as an intermediary. The logic flow for this is as follows (using $XAI as the bridge asset in this example): This does mean that Silo is less capital-efficient than shared-pool lending markets but is a requirement to maintain full risk isolation for depositors. The bridge assets are the tokens which can be deposited as collateral or borrowed from any silo and thus serves as the intermediary for $XYZ &lt;&gt; $ABC lend-borrow positions. Currently the two bridge assets available are $ETH and $XAI. $XAI is Silo\\'s stablecoin and can be borrowed into existence from the XAI-ETH and $USDC silos. As such, $XAI is an over-collateralized stablecoin which is backed by $ETH and $USDC. The notion of being able to borrow $XAI into existence is known as a \\'credit line\\' which has currently been extended to $ETH and $USDC only. As the Silo protocol develops and $XAI on-chain liquidity expands, credit lines may be extendable to additional token silos. As the extension of credit lines occur, the backing of $XAI will change correspondingly. Since $XAI is borrowed into existence and minted by the SiloDAO, newly minted $XAI accrues interest to the Silo Treasury. Since Silo is a decentralized protocol, governance decisions must be approved by $SILO holders. Governance decisions that can be voted on include, but are not limited to: ", "Single Finance is a super intuitive platform for all your DeFi investments, minimizing correlations with the general market  <br/> Sources: https://docs.singlefinance.io/home/tokenomics/single-token ", "SiO2 Finance is the Astar-native lending hub supporting both EVM and WASM.

Users could mint Snowbank tokens (SB) by depositing MIM, SB-MIM LP, wAVAX, SB-AVAX LP and SDOG-MIM LP[1]. It was launched by Snowbank Labs, an anonymous team during the start of \"ohm-fork\" season. On 17th February, the team started their \"Final Distribution\" event [2] and is no longer active as of now. Snowbank DAO is closely associated with Snowdog DAO, another Olympus fork from Snowbank Labs. Snowbank DAO stealth launched on 8th November 2021 with a tweet from their twitter account. Within few hours of launch, it garnered a lot of attention. In just 12 hours, it had amassed a treasury of $21,465,784. The first 72 hours were known as the ignition period where users could obtain cards based on whether users staked, minted or both. The cards never went on to have a utility despite a planned benefit.[3] On 8th of November, Snowbank Labs teased the launch of Snowdog DAO, the first meme currency of Avalanche.[4] On 15th of November, Snowdog officially launched. On 25th of November, Snowdog performed their treasury buyback but it was not well-executed and led to many community members criticising Snowbank Labs. Read the Snowdog Incident subsection for more information. On 14th of December, the team initiated a Snowbank V2 proposal, introducing their turbine system and governance token. Snowbank planned to own liiquidity for tokens (turbines) where users can vote for with gSB (governance Snowbank tokens). Once the turbines are voted in, users could mint SB tokens by providing liquidity for those partnered tokens while receiving partner incentives in some cases.[5] To obtain gSB, users simply had to stake SB tokens. Snowbank DAO also planned for SB to go cross-chain starting with Ethereum[6] and for SB to be used as collateral in partnered protocols. On 23rd of December, the team allowed users to choose between swapping their Snowbank tokens for the treasury backing or keeping Snowbank tokens in preparation for Snowbank V2. On 17th of February, the team started their \"Final Distribution\" event where users can swap their SB tokens for the treasury backing. <i>See main article: Snowdog DAO</i> Snowdog DAO was an Olympus DAO fork that planned to use the treasury to buyback all Snowdog tokens on the 25th of November. Vesting period for minted snowdog tokens were 3 days instead of the usual 5 days. On the 25th of November, the treasury was worth $44,363,794. Snowdog liquidity was pulled off Trader Joe and moved to a private AMM pool controlled by Snowbank.[7] The assets in the pool (SDOG to MIM) were proportioned as if the buyback had already happened. Slippage was locked at 99% and price of Snowdog tokens plummeted by 95% (compared to post-buyback value) in 30 seconds from open. With only 7% of the SDOG supply having the potential to be sold at a profit during the buyback, many holders were forced to sell below market price or face further losses, resulting in a 90% drawdown[8], the Snowdog community turned to the founding members of Snowbank for compensation. Snowbank then renounced ownership of Snowdog and passed on all social media accounts, SDOG tokens and SDOG-MIM LP to the community. ", "Solace is a decentralized insurance protocol that offers users protection from risks in DeFi products like smart contract exploits, hacks, and other technical failures. It was founded on 10 January 2021 by Nikita Buzov. Solace is a decentralized insurance protocol designed as an answer to the emerging hacks in the DeFi space. Solace aims to keep the protocol simple, and to be the first almost entirely automatized coverage protocol, keeping the human error margin to a minimum. Solace\\'s risk assessment does not rely on community votes.. Instead, Solace has a risk assessment process designed to grade protocols automatically based on the age, history of exploits, and several other parameters defining the safety of a protocol. Following the automatized risk assessment, Solace automates the payouts. Users are paid within a week from when the exploit happened without having to file a claimSolace\\'s wallet coverage is a solution to collectively cover all assets available on an individual\\'s wallet.(180+ protocols covered) for an estimated in advance price. The rate is flexible and varies depending on the inflow/outflow of assets from the wallet. Solace is known for high staking APYs of its native token $SOLACE and a mechanic known from OlympusDAO: bonding to acquire liquidity in the protocol\\'s underwriting pool (UWP). It\\'s important to mention the UWP does NOT consist of $SOLACE staker tokens. Nikita Buzov, founder of Solace, started the protocol after being dissatisfied with the existing crypto insurance solutions He came across the idea as he was deploying funds into DeFi apps and farming. Assessing and hedging the risk is a tough task, so seeing how much liquidity is protected with insurance he realized there has to be another way: his aim was to automatize and simplify an insurance for everyone. Claims processed by Solace are validated immediately and payouts happen in a single transaction, being a step further toward getting rid of the human error. Joined by Matt Ladin, Amir Alnadi, Danny Fung, Selcuk Souzer and Ivan Andreev and initially Jimmy Chang, the team started building Solace and finding VCs willing to back the project. Eventually, Solace raised $1.14 million in a seed round, which converted at a $30 million dollar valuation. The round was led by Parataxis Capital and joined by Alchemy, StableNode, LD Capital, 1010.capital and Prycto. Alongside these funds, several individual investors joined the seed round, including: Illia Polosukhin from NEAR, Jeffrey Zirlin from Axie Infinity, Julien Bouteloup from StakeDAO &amp; rekt.news, Evgeny Yurtaev from Zerion, Alex Shevchenko from Aurora, Sandeep Nailwal from Polygon, Kiril Nikolov from Nexo, Seth Ginns from CoinFund, Aleksander Larsen from Axie Infinity, and Quentin Milne from Stake Capital. The team doubled in December 2021, hiring additional developers, and introducing two new divisions: Growth and Risk Management. <br/> Early approach on capital bootstrapping for the underwriting pool was options liquidity mining, where early investors could deposit ETH into the underwriting pool and back the coverage policies and could claim their SOLACE in form of an option. In this rewards program which took about 2 months Solace distributed around 2% of $SOLACE total token supply. Initially Solace Coverage V1 only offered coverage for a few Ethereum-based protocols: yearn, Uniswap, Sushiswap, Compound, Liquity, Aave and Curve. Solace featured a single capital pool to underwrite risk across every policy offered. This pool was funded by capital providers, who earned revenue from policy sales and Solace incentives. <br/> Eventually Solace 2.0 started with token launch and a re-thought through mechanism on how to acquire more money into the underwriting pool. Instead of using user\\'s money to pay out claims, which obviously big investors would be hesitant to do, Solace owns its UWP (underwriting pool), which is filled with money from bonds. Bonds allow users to buy $SOLACE directly from the protocol, but at a discount. Eventually the amount of $SOLACE is limited to 1B of which 10% is meant to be in the UWP. With Solace V2 also the coverage changed: Solace introduced its flagship product, the Solace Wallet Coverage which allows you to cover your entire wallet with one single flexible policy. <br/> Solace is a cross-chain protocol now online on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon and Aurora. Future plans include spreading on other blockchains like Avalanche, BNB, Fantom, and others. Furthermore the team plans a cross-chain balancing of staking/locking APY%. Further plans include launching on non-EVM compatible chains and transitioning to a full community-run DAO and eventually aims to launch Solace Market - an open cover product platform. <br/> Solace faces various problems like low interest from retail policyseekers due to a risk-loving nature of crypto-native people. A coverage doesn\\'t seem like something attractive for someone willing to risk half of their life funds to 10x it. Besides, the concept of automated risk rating seems strange and unfamiliar to new potential investors. The Solace team combats it with creative advertising and the necessity for DeFi to mature. Its intelligent flagship product, the Solace Wallet Coverage offers coverage for the following types of exploits: minting vulnerability, flash loan attack, trojan fake token, proxy manipulation, math error, re-entry attack. SWC is designed to be a simple tool for everyone that allows you to quickly and effectively get a policy and forget about it, as its flexible and adjusts to changing assets in your wallet. <br/> Solace will soon release its DAO2DAO project as a counterweight to its Solace Wallet Coverage designed for individuals. ", "Solend is an algorithmic, decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing built on Solana. On Solana, Solend can scale to being faster and cheaper. Currently, Solend is the most popular lending and borrowing protocol on Solana (according to DeFiLlama). Borrow APYs are set as a function of utilization, where APY changes based on how much of the pool is borrowed. Each token has it\\'s own \"Min\", \"Optimal\" &amp; \"Max\" that is laid out in the parameters page. This way, the protocol can set market friendly rates that attract inflow of capital when utilization rises, while also keeping rates in line for borrowers. Users who supply, get an APY from the users who borrow. The borrow APY is split across the entire pool, so Supply APY = Borrow APY * Utilization. For example, if there is 2 BTC in a pool, and 1 BTC is lent out at 20% APY, the suppliers of the 2 BTC will receive 10% APY each. This APY is given in the same token as the supply. Deposit BTC for BTC yields, or SOL for SOL yields. When a user is borrowing, they are paying a Borrow APY to the pool (for the users who supplied). This borrow APY is calculated based on the Parameters &amp; The Math, and are displayed on their UI when a user is borrowing. Borrow APY is added to the user\\'s loan on a per-slot basis, so the amount of money a user has to repay goes up over time.  Solend\\'s token is called SLND, the total supply is 100 million SLND. The tokens are allocated as follows:", "Solidly is an Automated Market Maker focusing on low-slippage trades between assets, created by Andre Cronje on the Fantom Network.

Solvent is a platform to enable index funds for NFTs on Solana. NFT holders that want liquidity out of their NFTs can deposit their NFT asset into its particular NFT collection on Solvent for minting fungible tokens (droplets) of that particular NFT project in return. These fungible tokens are tradable on Serum orderbooks just like any other tokens on Solana. This means that these droplets can be used for all DeFi applications and on-chain protocols Buckets are vault-like collections of NFT projects on Solvent. Every NFT project on Solana will have its own bucket on Solvent. For minting fungible tokens of the NFT project (droplets), one needs to deposit their NFT asset into its suitable bucket. For eg. If one has a Degen Ape NFT and is looking for some liquidity through Solvent, they can do so by going to the Degen Ape bucket and depositing the NFT to mint fungible droplets of the Degen Ape project, let\\'s say $DAPE. Once a user deposits an NFT to any bucket for minting droplets, they lose ownership of that NFT. Droplets are fungible tokens representing NFT projects on Solana. They\\'re just like any other Solana token like $USDC or $GRAPE. You can mint droplets by depositing your NFTs to their specific bucket. $SVT is Solvent\\'s governance token. There are benefits of holding the SVT token, which are: The tokenomics of the $SVT token are yet to be released. ", "Sphynx Labs is an all-in-one solution for trading and investing.

Different from other DEXs, SpookySwap invested in building a strong foundation with the BOO token as a governance token, diverse farms, a built in bridge, built in limit orders and user-centered service. <br/> As of its launch in April 2021, Spooky has: Token swaps on SpookySwap are a simple way to trade one token for another via automated liquidity pools. On Spooky, users can trade at market price, or set a specific price for a limit order that can be triggered 24/7. When you swap (trade) on the exchange, users will pay a 0.2% trading fee (0.22% for limit orders), of which 0.17% is returned to liquidity pools as a reward for liquidity providers and 0.03% to xBOO Stakers. None of this fee is going to the treasury or dev fund like traditional DEXs. Adding liquidity allows the contributor to earn 0.2% swapping fees from the pairs they\\'ve provided. Users can supply liquidity and start earning fees via adding liquidity here. The liquidity can earn even more rewards (BOOs) if they\\'re staked at farms. When users provide liquidity, they will receive spLP tokens (Spooky Liquidity Provider tokens) as proof of contribution. For example, if a user deposited $BOO and $FTM into a pool they would receive BOO-FTM spLP tokens. These tokens represent a proportional share of the pooled assets. These spLP tokens can be staked at farms to earn BOO. There are 18+ pairs for you to stake, one of the most diverse farms on Fantom chain. The Liquidity farm is the place to stake your spLP (Spooky Liquidity Pair tokens) to earn BOOs. These farms provide incentives to people providing liquidity to SpookySwap and help offset Impermanent Loss risk. Single-stake pools is where only one type of token is needed to stake. No LP token-making is required, but the concept is similar to making a liquidity token (LP), and staking that LP in a farm to earn other tokens. By staking BOO, users immediately receive xBOO tokens as proof, which can be staked in partner pools to earn other tokens. The buyback single-stake pool is where users can stake BOO and receive xBOO tokens. It only requires 1 ingredient, BOO, hence the name \"single-stake.\" With the xBOO you receive, users can stake to earn other tokens in the pool list. The staked xBOO will continue to participate in the Buyback Pool and earn more BOOs.

This created an incentive for Uniswap users to move their liquidity over to Sushiswap instead. However, on 5th September 2020, Chef Nomi pulled the liquidity by swapping his development share of SUSHI to ETH, causing the SUSHI\\'s token price to drop 70% within the day.

", "Synthetix is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum and Optimistic Ethereum (a layer two scaling solution built on Ethereum). These synthetic assets are collateralized by the Synthetix Network Token (SNX) which when locked in the contract enables the issuance of synthetic assets (Synths). This pooled collateral model allows users to perform conversions between Synths directly with the smart contract, avoiding the need for counterparties. This mechanism solves the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by DEX\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Synthetix currently supports synthetic fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies (long and short) and commodities. SNX holders are incentivized to stake their tokens as they are paid a pro-rata portion of the fees generated through activity on Synthetix from integrators (Kwenta, Lyra, Curve, dHEDGE, and many others). It is the right to participate in the network and capture fees generated from Synth exchanges, from which the value of the SNX token is derived. Trading on the Synthetix infrastructure does not require the trader to hold SNX. Many protocols have built ontop of the Synthetix infrastructure. These include but are not limited to, Kwenta which offers perpetual futures and spot exchanges, Lyra which offers options trading, Curve which offers cross asset swaps, and dHEDGE which allows traders to pool capital and offer a decentralized hedge fund service. Why SNX holders stake Synthetix staking is vastly different from other DeFi protocols; it allows anyone to earn rewards by contributing collateral (SNX) to the Synthetix protocol. Staked SNX enables the many benefits for protocols built on Synthetix, such as deep liquidity, low slippage, and highly competitive fees for traders. Staked SNX performs several crucial tasks: For basic steps on how to stake and for claiming weekly see this guide: https://blog.synthetix.io/basics-of-staking-snx-2022/ Synthetix has partnered with dHEDGE to deploy a one-click debt mirror index for SNX stakers on Optimism. Initially, this tool was launched onto mainnet, but it is now live on Optimism. This guide can be found here: https://blog.synthetix.io/dhedge-debt-mirror-index-token-2/ Recently Synthetix partnered with Gelato to allow stakers to automatically claim their SNX staking rewards on Optimism. As of right now, the integration enables stakers to claim their weekly rewards once their C-Ratio is above the target C-Ratio (as of right now, this is 350%). To learn how to do this go here: https://blog.synthetix.io/automated-claiming-from-gelato-only-live-on-optimism/ <br/> <br/> Why trade synthetic assets? Synthetic assets provide exposure to an asset without holding the underlying resource. This has a range of advantages, including reducing the friction when switching between different assets, expanding the accessibility of certain assets, and censorship resistance. **Advantages of Synthetix Infrastructure ** Trading on Synthetix infrastructure provides many advantages over centralized exchanges and order book based DEX\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. The lack of an order book means all trades are executed against the contract, known as P2C (peer-to-contract) trading. Assets are assigned an exchange rate through price feeds supplied by an oracle, and can be converted using the Kwenta.io dApp. This provides infinite liquidity up to the total amount of collateral in the system, zero slippage, and permissionless on-chain trading. Synthetic futures Synthetix has recently launched Perpetual Futures Beta. Anyone with access to the internet can leverage Synthetix\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure to access up to 10x leverage on an evergrowing list of Synthetic assets. https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-perpetual-futures/ Kwenta, a fully decentralized and composable protocol with an easy-to-use trading UI, is the first partner to integrate Synthetix\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perps. Synthetix perps markets are accessible through a dedicated Kwenta UI. Synthetix\\'s perpetual futures enable a much expanded and capital-efficient trading experience by allowing both leveraged longs and shorts on a large selection of assets. For SNX stakers, futures provide an additional revenue stream due to exchange and funding rate fees and reduce the need to hedge the additional debt due to inherent self-hedging and controlled exposure through market size limits. Another useful property of Synthetix\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perps markets is that support for new assets can be expanded more readily for futures than for spot assets. This is because perpetual markets don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share some of the limitations and risks of spot synths, allowing for more assets to be safely added. This means that the Synthetix protocol may soon offer a broader range of perpetual futures pairs than many competitors. Atomic Swaps Atomic Swaps are a new exchange function allowing users to atomically exchange assets with a reasonable fee by pricing synth exchanges via a combination of Chainlink and DEX oracles (Uniswap V3) This helps to enable seamless trading between synthetic assets like sETH, sUSD, sBTC, etc. A unique property of this is that for large trade sizes, it greatly reduces the overall cost for traders due to slippage. Learn about Atomic Swaps and why they benefit SNX stakers here: https://blog.synthetix.io/atomic-exchanges-synthetixs-mainnet-volume/ Perps V2 and The Future of Perps Perpetual futures will be updated drastically to improve on the following goals: Kwenta isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the only one building ontop of futures, Polynomial is also building a basis trading vault to generate fees for users by capturing the inconsistencies between the spot market and its corresponding perpetual futures.

Generate and secure the initial liquidity, lock your tokens with vesting lockers and create farms with customizable rewards. ", "The Uniswap protocol is a permissionless peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies. The protocol was founded by Hayden Adams in 2018. Uniswap uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. An AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative price of the two assets shifts, and a new market rate (price) for both is determined. [1] A liquidity provider (LP) is someone who deposits a pair of tokens to a smart contract. In return, they\\'re compensated with a percentage of the trading fees for the given pair. [2] A liquidity provider share of the pool is represented by the LP token, unique for each liquidity pool. LP tokens automatically earn the trading fees, since they represent a portion of the whole pool which grows as fees are accumulated. Swaps are the most common use. For users, swapping is straightforward: a user selects an ERC-20 token that they own and a token they would like to trade it for. Executing a swap sells the currently owned tokens for the proportional amount of the tokens desired, minus the swap fee, which is given to liquidity providers. [3] When transactions are submitted to Ethereum, their order of execution is established by the gas price offered as a fee for executing each transaction. The higher the gas price, the faster the transaction is included in a new block. The transactions with an insufficient gas price will remain pending for an indeterminate amount of time. During this time, the price environment in which the transaction will eventually be executed will change, as other swaps will be taking place. [4] Uniswap V3 introduced the concept of concentrated liquidity provision. This allows users to provide liquidity for a certain pool, only in a predetermined price range. Concentrated liquidity reduces slippage since, provided most liquidity will be found at prices close to the actual price at which the tokens are currently trading, traders will tap into a deeper pool while LPs will earn more fees as long as the price stays within the range of their LP position. With concentrated liquidity LP tokens are no longer fungible, they are NFTs (ERC-721) which represent both the amount of tokens supplied and the price range. Concentrated liquidity also worsens impermanent loss: the narrower the price range, the more a price movement affects the token balances on the LP position.

Both Platypus and Trader Joe allow users to lock PTP and JOE tokens in return for their vote-escrowed (ve) versions. The yield for liquidity providers is then determined not only by the size of their liquidity position but also by the amount of vePTP or veJOE they hold. While giving more utility to underlying tokens and discouraging mercenary behaviour this model makes participation more difficult for smaller investors and exposes users to the price action of the asset they don\\'t necessarily want to hold. Vector solves these problems by aggregating PTP and JOE tokens for the users by both encouraging conversion into their wrapped versions (xPTP and zJOE) and by reinvesting a portion of yield rewards.

Originally, iEarn was a series of yield bearing tokens which rebalanced to the lending markets with the highest yield (usually AAVE or Compound).[1]During DeFi summer, the protocol released a fair-launched governance token called YFI and rebranded to Yearn Finance. The launch is credited to have birthed the concept of Pool 2[2], it took place on Curve Finance and Balancer. Today the protocol is maintained by various independent developers and contributors of the Yearn DAO and it is governed by $YFI holders. The current user-facing core product of Yearn is yVaults, which provide automated yield generation to many different crypto assets, each driven by one or more Strategies. yVault is short for Yearn Vault.

Anyone can build a Strategy, but in order to get it added to a yVault, the strategist needs to pass the strategy through the strategy vetting process[3] which includes concept vetting, code review, security review, and mainnet testing. For their efforts, strategists are rewarded with a portion of the strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance fee. In July 2020 the YFI token was introduced as a way for Andre to decentralize control of Yearn by distributing 30.000 YFI tokens. The 30.000 YFI would be distributed only to uses who provided liquidity on Yearn. YFI launched with no pre-mine, no pre-sale, and no allocation to the team.[4] Another 6,666 YFI were minted by YIP-57 in order to fund Yearn\\'s future, so the total supply of YFI is 36,666. As the governance token of Yearn, YFI tokens allow holders to vote on various decisions proposed by community members.
